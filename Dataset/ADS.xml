<Text>
<Sentence ID="1.1">according to the javadoc in platform.getresourcestring(bundle,string), this method has been deprecated and one should use the nls class or the bundlefinder.find()</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.2">i was able to find the nls class but i didn ' t find the bundlefinder class</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.3">is the javadoc correct</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.4">if it is a hint on where to find the bundlefinder class would help</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.5">the nls class doesn ' t seem to provide me with the same functionality that platform.getresourcestring does, so i am assuming that bundlefinder would do the job that i need</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="8.1">hi konstantin, i guess i didn ' t anticipate the fallout, or at least understand the migration problem</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.2">as a result of the change in 2.0, if any server runtime uses an id that isn ' t identical to it ' s name, the project will fail migration</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.3">after moving to wtp 2.0, the project will no longer be targeted to the runtime and users have to manually reset it</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.4">while the manual workaround is fairly easy, fixing this regression should be too - all we have to do is allow for alternate facet runtime names under the covers, or check for a migrated name if the old one doesn ' t exist when reading the facets file</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.5">the runtime bridge and/or stub both have the id from wtp 1.5 and can provide this information back to the facet framework</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.6">this could be provided in whatever format makes the most sense for the facet framework, e.g. an alternate name for a runtime or a mapping from old to new names (or vice versa)</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.7">angel has proposed a couple patches already, but since they touch the facet ' s framework we need your expertise on what the correct/minimal fix would be</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="10.1">* explain why you believe this is a stop-ship defect</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="10.2">or, if it is a " hotbug " (requested by an adopter) please document it as such</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="10.3">adopter ' s are expecting an ifile as a parameter to the modulefile constructor when the resource is a workspace resource and are expecting a java.io.file for external resources</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="10.4">this issue exposes a regression issue where now only java.io.file is used regardless of whether the resource is a workspace or external resource</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="10.5">* is there a work-around</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="10.6">if so, why do you believe the work-around is insufficient</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="1.2">while looking for the cause of bug 196847, i got suspicious about a usage of the so called fuzz factor</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.3">i thought that i knew what it means and what is it for even though i hadn ' t use it before</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.4">however, after taking a closer look at the code i got confused</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.5">for example, please, correct me if i ' m wrong, in hunkresult#calculatefuzz[1] method we are calculating the most appropriate shift value which has nothing to do with the fuzz factor</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.6">looking further, in hunk#trypatch[2] , when we came across a context line ( ' ' char) we should use the fuzz factor</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.7">i can see no sign of such an action there</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.8">i could give you more example, but that ' s not my point</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.9">i think we should take a second look at the patcher algorithm</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.10">name some methods more accurately, add some javadocs or maybe even fix some things</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.11">but first of all, we should add plenty of unit tests just to make sure after " refactoring " is done, everything still works as expected</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="5.1">created an attachment (id=79481) testcase for the bug</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="5.2">this is a testcase showing that the fuzz factor is not working as expected, actually is not working at all</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="5.3">i ' ve modified slightly the patchtest class, so now one can use the fuzz factor as a parameter</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="5.4">but this is not what the patch is mainly about</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="5.5">the major part of it are the additional tests located in " patchdata " subfolder</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="5.6">they assume that the fuzz factor works and that the patches from the subfolders can be applied</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="5.7">unfortunately, most of the will fail as the fuzz factor doesn ' t work</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="5.8">to make the tests pass we will need to apply the patch from the next comment</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="7.1">i ' ve looked at the patch and i ' ll do my best to provide comments</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="7.2">given the complexity of the algorithm, i think the most important thing is to have a good set of tests to ensure the proper behavior</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="7.3">or, in other words, i have a hard time verifying the code via inspection</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="7.4">here are my comments</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="7.5">1) in the hunkresult#calculatefuzz, it seems to scan the whole file looking for possible matches</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="7.6">to me, this implies that it would be possible to get hunks matching out of order</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="7.8">2) the maximum fuzz seems to be hardcoded at 2 with the assumption that there are 3 lines of context</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="7.9">what if there are less content lines</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="7.10">what if there are more</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="7.11">3) in hunk#trypatch i must admit that i can ' t really figure out what you are doing there (e.g i don ' t get the 2+2, 3+2 and 2+3 splits you are doing)</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="7.12">the best approach here may be to sit down with szymon and go over the algorithm with him (i.e. i don ' t have that much knowledge about the algorithm anyway and going over it with someone there would probably be faster then doing it though a bug report or instant messaging)</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="7.13">4) in regards to ignoring the context lines during the patch application, how is the case handle were there is an addition following the context lines</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="7.14">wouldn ' t you need to know how many context lines to skip in order to place the addition properly</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="8.3">is this the case</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.4">yes, it ' s possible in some cases</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.5">do you think we should prevent the patcher from allowing such cases</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.6">i do agree that it can be confusing and i don ' t mind if we won ' t allow it</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="8.10">i was afraid you will ask that question</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.11">i know that hardcoding the max fuzz is not enough</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.12">i would change current 2 to lines.size() which is number of lines in a file</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.13">that would work, wouldn ' t it</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.14">but i ' ve a different question</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.15">what should happen when we have fuzz factor greater or equal to number of lines of a hunk</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.16">should we ignore all of the context lines or should we match at least one</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.17">what if we ' re in the middle of " calculating fuzz " and the fuzz goes up</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.18">i would allow ignoring all context lines, but that ' s just my opinion</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.19">i know that default values are 3 for context lines and 2 for maximum fuzz factor, but we could inform a user that he/she exceed the maximum value</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="8.21">[...] well, i will throw it away</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.22">my idea was to apply the fuzz factor to any context lines, not only to the ones at the end or at the beginning of a hunk</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.23">but i had a discussion with szymon about that and we decided to keep the context lines in the middle as they are - they must match</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.24">&gt; 4) in regards to ignoring the context lines during the patch application, how is &gt; the case handle were there is an addition following the context lines</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="8.26">or am i missing something</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.27">yep, this is how it works</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.28">i do collect context lines before processing an addition/change/deletion</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.29">the same thing happens with context lines following a change</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.30">the only problem is that i need to recognize which context lines are preceding a hunk and which follows it</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.31">if i get that information right i can than try to match the hunk ignoring some of the context lines</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="9.1">regarding hunk ordering, i can see that there might be some cases where changing the order of hunks would find matches that wouldn ' t otherwise be found</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="9.2">ideally, i think we should try to match in order first and only try out-of-order matches if an in-order match couldn ' t be found</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="9.3">regarding the default maximum fuzz factor, i ' m ok with using a hardcoded value to start with but lets use a constant for it so we can easily find references to it easily</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="9.4">as to whether we can ignore all content lines, i think that we need to be careful</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="9.5">it really depends on the nature of the change</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="9.6">for instance, if the patch is a straight addition, it may be dangerous to ignore even one content line, especially if one or more of the content lines are whitespace</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="9.7">however, if the before state of the patch has many lines in it, you could probably get away with ignoring all the context lines</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="9.8">it would be good to have a set of tests that cover some of these corner cases to ensure that the algorithm behaves as the user would expect.</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="1.2">imo using regexp should be enough here, especially due to the fact that we don ' t want to make any additional dependencies</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.3">so, my proposal is to allow to specify a regexp rule for lines that should be count as a " real contribution "</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.4">this is what first came to my head</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.5">^\+? (\s*\S+\s*)+$</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.6">which means " count only lines starting with single ' + ' and a space</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.7">the line must also have at least one non-whitespace character "</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.8">i think this is more/less what martin ' s script does</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.9">all lines that match the above pattern would be sum up and the info would be displayed somewhere on the apply patch wizard</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.10">how does it sound</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.11">martin</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="3.1">excellent idea</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.2">having the line counter right in the apply patch wizard would finally give us a standard way of counting lines that everybody could use easily</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.3">my script also ignores " empty comment " lines of the form ^\+\s+[#*] +\s+$ but that ' s really neglectible and i ' m fine with your approach of counting any non-empty added line in the patch</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.4">actually, couldn ' t your regex even be simpler, say ^\+\s+\s since you don ' t need to check till the end of the line?</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="4.1">and actually, if the wizard counts added lines, why shouldn ' t it also count removed lines</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="4.2">giving two separate numbers e.g</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="4.3">10 lines added 20 lines removed this sounds familiar to me since i ' ve seen similar numbers in rcs files before</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="4.4">i ' d guess that the regex for removed lines could just be the same as for added lines but the + replaced by a -</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="4.5">and, files removed entirely should contribute the entire number of lines they had before (i believe that the old contents is not recorded in the diff, is it?)</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="16.1">it ' s awsome that this is customizeable, but when i remember right, one reason for putting this enhancement into eclipse sdk was such that there is a " common standard " by which the projects count their lines in a patch</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="16.2">i think that this " common standard " should be as good as possible by default</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="16.3">on the other hand, having some magic like removing empty lines from the count going on in the background is perhaps a problem..</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="17.1">martin, i see your point when you ' re saying that the " common standard " should be as good as possible, however i would rather not to filter any lines from a patch when parsing</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="17.2">here are the approaches so far</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="17.3">1) use only given filters, by default no counting will be made</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="17.4">this is how the patch from comment 4 worked</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="17.5">rejected</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="17.6">2) by default count lines using the simple patterns, which are currently used when parsing a patch (ie " + " and " - " ), this can be modified in the pref page</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="17.7">patch in comment 13</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="17.8">in head</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="17.9">3) by default count lines using more sophisticated patterns like excluding empty lines</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="17.10">and again, this can be modified in the pref page</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="17.11">if i understood you correctly this is what you meant in comment 15</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="17.12">my main concern here is</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="17.13">what if i would like to know total number of lines added in the patch (the filter idea looks to be an answer here but it ' s a pref value, it ' s not embedded in the parser itself, right?)</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="17.14">4) by default count lines using both simple and sophisticated patterns at the same time</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="17.15">the output would be something like this " patch contains x added and y removed lines + z added lines which are empty "</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="17.16">again, the user could provide his own patterns..</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="17.17">which makes the whole mechanism overblown and not as intuitive as i would like it to be</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="17.18">regarding the filter idea</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="17.19">it sounds good to me, but i think we should move the discussion about it to a separate bug</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="3.1">brian and i have been looking at this issue, and after some println debugging were able to identify the cause of the race condition</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.2">the root of this issue is in adapterfactoryproxy and its use of the factoryloaded flag</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.3">the summary is that factoryloaded can be set to true and accessed by another thread as true before the actual factory has been assigned in the proxy</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.4">this results in null being returned for an adapter factory that could be successfully loaded by has not yet been loaded</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.5">details</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.6">during workbench start-up, depending on the what the ui context is for a given workbench session, multiple dali jpa projects may end up being built concurrently</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.7">in this situation, multiple threads end up making a call to iproject.getadatper(...) around the same time to retrieve a particular adapter that is needed to build a jpa project</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.8">what ends up happening in the case where this fails (which is 50-75% of the time depending on the number and size of projects in the workspace) is</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.9">- a call is made to iproject.getadatper(...) on thread a</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.10">- the adapterfactoryproxy in question has already been pre-built, but the internal factory has not yet been loaded (it is lazily loaded)</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.11">- adapterfactoryproxy.getadapter(...) calls loadfactory(...) to load the real adapterfactory, as factoryloaded is set to false</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.12">- factoryloaded flag is set to true in loadfactory(...) before the factory instance var has been assigned</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.13">- thread b has also called iproject.getadatper(...), which has gone to the proxy, where the factoryloaded check in getadapter(...) returns true but the factory itself has not yet been assigned and therefore not actually loaded</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.14">- as a result, thread b s call to getadapter(...) returns a factory proxy that has a null internal factory, which results in a return value of null from adaptermanager.getadapter(...)</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.15"> proposed solution: i have attached a patch that solves the issue by changing when the factoryloaded flag is set to true</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.16">the intended behavior of this flag should stay the same and avoid the race condition by setting the factoryloaded flag in a finally block</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.17">since the factoryloaded flag is double-checked, it should prevent any redundant loading of the proxy s factory , given that the loadfactory(...) method is synchronized</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.18">other notes</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.19">the adapterfactoryproxy.loadfactory(...) method is synchronized, but the adapterfactoryproxy.getadapter(...) method is not, so we cannot rely on the synchronized loadfactory(...) method to prevent a race condition in relation to the factoryloaded flag.</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="1.1">here is the javadoc for iadaptermanager.computeclassorder(class)</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.2">returns the class search order for a given class</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="1.5">x - x ' s superclasses in order to object - a breadth-first traversal of the target class ' s interfaces in the order returned by getinterfaces (in the example, a and its superinterfaces then b and its superinterfaces) this comment is not perfectly clear</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.6">in particular, it does not complete the example by explicitly listing the exact order the example classes and interfaces are returned</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.7">i came up with a slightly richer example</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.8">interface a extends m, n interface b extends o class y implements c, d class x extends y implements a, b [the declarations for interfaces c, d, m, n, and o are trivial.] the order of classes and interfaces returned by adaptermanager.computeclassorder(x) is</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.9">class x interface a interface b interface m interface n interface o class y interface c interface d class java.lang.object this conflicts with the javadoc</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.10">the class x is the first thing returned, but it is *not* followed by " x ' s superclasses in order to object "</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.11">it is followed by a breadth-first list of x ' s interface hierarchy " , *then* followed by x ' s superclass y, which is then followed by a breadth-first list of y ' s interface hierarchy</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.12">and so on, up to java.lang.object</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.13">also, the javadoc has what reads to me as a contradiction</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="1.15">in the example, a and its superinterfaces then b and its superinterfaces what actually happens *does* feel like a " breadth-first " search</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="2.1">you are right on both counts</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="2.2">the implementation doesn ' t match the spec, and there is a contradiction in the spec itself</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="2.3">now the question is what do we do about it</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="2.4">- for the contradiction, i think we should stick with the breadth-first search, and delete the parenthetic comment about the example ( " a and its superinterfaces then b and its superinterfaces " )</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="2.5">- for the spec not matching the behaviour, my instinct is to " fix " the spec to match the implementation, to avoid the risk of breaking clients</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="2.6">this would be a very subtle change that could affect clients in unpredictable ways</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="2.7">on the other hand if there are really compelling reasons to change the implementation to match the spec, i ' d be curious to hear them</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="2.8">i did some research and found that the implementation did match the spec until febuary 20, 2004, when i change the implementation</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="2.9">at that time the spec wasn ' t part of the api</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="2.10">the spec was later added to the api (iadaptermanager#computeclassorder) without checking that the implementation still matched</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="3.3">i can see arguments for either way</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.4">but i guess i would probably come down on the side of giving specification precedence</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="3.5">so, i guess you argue further that all the interfaces could precede all the classes</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="4.3">i noticed the spec also doesn ' t mention the interfaces of the target class ' superclasses</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="1.2">in workbench.init() we read the source providers of the ' org.eclipse.ui.services ' extension point and there all extensions are immediately loaded (createexecutableextension) no matter whether the contributing bundle is already started</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.3">unfortunately this happens before the workbench itself is correctly initialized (workbench colors in this particular case)</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.4">this can cause troubles for upstream bundles that expect the workbench colors and/or fonts to be present when they get loaded</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.5">it would be good if the workbench could initialize as much as possible before calling code that starts other bundles</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.6">we should either - protect the code to not load those extensions</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.7">we do similar things e.g. when loading the handler service (see org.eclipse.ui.internal.handlers.handlerproxy.isoktoload()</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.8">the hard part here is to make sure that the extension which aren ' t loaded still work somehow, e.g. by adding a proxy</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.9">- initialize default services after colors and fonts (this might be the simplest fix but would need extensive testing).</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="10.2">yes - i apologize again for the mess</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="11.6">when starting to work on a maintenance branch you have two choices</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="11.7">- replace all head plug-ins with the version ( ' r3_5 ' in this case) - delete all head plug-ins except the one you want to branch basically the main point is to make sure that nothing is from head</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="1.1">mattn noticed a problem with the wip patch from bug 469443 applied</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.2">when typing in the search box, sometimes search-suggestion entries would be displayed above the divider (where entries for previous matching searches are)</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.3">the problem here is that nssearchsuggestions.js is passing the wrong previousresult to form history</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.4">instead of it being the previous form history search result, it ' s the suggestautocompleteresult result (which contains the union of the form-history and search-suggest entries)</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.5">so, when form history refines its results as you time, it can actually add *more* entries as data leaks from the suggestions result into form history result, and it thus looks like the divider is being drawn in the wrong place</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.6">this bug wasn ' t visible before 469443, because nsformfillcontroller</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.7">startsearch tries to qi the provided result to a nsiautocompletesimpleresult</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.8">the search-suggestion result is only implements nsiautocompletresult (no " simple " ), so the qi fails, historyresult nee previousresult becomes null, and thus satchel was doing a new search every time</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.9">eg</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.10">1) type " b " in the search field</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.11">2) form history finds 1 entry ( " blah " ), search-suggestions finds " baaa " , " bloop " , " bzzz " , the autocompete menu shows these in order with a divider between " blah " and " baaa "</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.12">3) type an " l " in the search field ( " bl " )</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.13">4) starthistorysearch() ' s previous result contains [ " blah " , " baaa " , " bloop " , " bzzz " ], satchel filters this down to [ " blah " , " bloop " ] to match the new " bl " search string</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.14">5) nssearchsuggestions ' s onreadystate() change is called with updated search suggestions, builds up a new list of results, but sees that the form history result now has *two* entries.</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="2.1">the example you cite can lead to dataloss</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="8.7">- nonetheless, msgkeychanged keeps going on and adds information in _keychangedbatchinfo, although the information is *wrong* because gloda is not aware of the existence of this message,</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.8">- then, we receive a msgclassified notification, which triggers a _reindexchangedmessages with adirtying=false,</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.9">- _keychangedbatchinfo says the message is not dirty (if i understood your comments properly, andrew, this means that the message has been indexed by gloda and is in a correct state), because that s what msgkeychanged said,</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.10">- _keychangedbatchinfo exits early with these two lines: if (!keychangedinfo.isdirty) continue</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.11">and the message is never indexed</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.12">the patch i m attaching basically says that msgkeychanged should not try to do anything smart if gloda hasn t indexed the fake header yet</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="11.4">however we must be sure that multimessageview.xhtml is loaded only once because this code is executed only once if i ' m not mistaken, so reloads wouldn ' t have the property set properly</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="11.6">there ' s only two buttons here so the user might want to keep text + icons in the multimessageview (because there ' s plenty of space) and still have icons only in the mail header (because there ' s no space)</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="1.1">rationale: i m currently writing a thunderbird-stdlib project which is basically a collection of jsms</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.2">extension authors are encouraged to checkout a copy of this into their tree, so that it appears as resource://theirext/stdlib/</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.3">problem is, module a from stdlib depends on module b from stdlib too</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.4">possible non-solutions include</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.5">- hardcode resource://theirext/ into stdlib s modules, which requires other extension authors to modify the stdlib, and makes their lives hell because i encourage the gitsubmodule way of checking it out, so that makes a difference with -master</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.6">- write resource://__import_prefix__/stdlib/ everywhere in stdlib, and package it with a shell script that automates the process (basically a whole bunch of find and sed s)</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.7">- use the magic __location__ and make a wild guess, from the extension id (xxx@yyy.tld), that the path will be resource://xxx/stdlib/ (and require the extension to be unpacked so that __location__ be defined</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.8">all of these are non-satisfactory, so i think relative urls should be accepted, i.e. i should be able to write</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="2.2">add a magic __uri__ global in jsms</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="2.3">so this is a middle-ground solution, in the sense that it implements a magic __uri__ global, just like __location__, in jsms</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="2.4">this allows jsms to know which uri they re being imported from, which would solve my problem</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="2.5">of course, the relative uri solution seems better in the long run, so i have little hope that this patch will be accepted</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="2.6">i m submitting this patch anyway for the following reasons</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="2.7">- to be honest, this is not my area of expertise, and the patch above fit nicely in the one-hour timespan that i was willing to devote to this issue =) (this includes firing up all the mozilla string guide pages on mdc!),</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="2.8">- now a more serious reason, i believe this is very low-risk, which gives it an epsilon chance of being accepted before firefox 4 (although i m only interested in seeing this happen in thunderbird, i still do believe it will be useful for other people)</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="2.9">- doing the relative import thing would make it absolutely not acceptable to land at this point of the release cycle,</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="2.10">- i m willing to spend more time to add support for relative uris in components.utils.import, maybe for firefox 5</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="2.11">although my xpcshell testing shows that redefining a var __uri__ global doesn t cause any warning, it might be that xpcshell ate them away</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="2.12">but this won t break any existing jsms</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="2.13">andreas, i ve requested review from you as you re listed as one of the peers for this module</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="5.1">if they ' ve been hidden it can be resolved through the tinderbox admin page - unfortunately, there ' s a bug in tinderbox wherein if machines have fallen off the waterfall due to idle time they are sometimes re-added as hidden when they do their new report</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="8.1">but no matter how many talos boxes the tree has, it ' ll still skip builds by design, won ' t it</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.2">this afternoon, there were linux builds that ran from 13:37-14:29, 14:02-14:19, and 14:07-14:24.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.3">what seems to have happened, that the one which started at 14</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.4">07 got a talos run and the other two didn ' t, fits pretty well with how it ' s been explained to me, that the poller runs every ten minutes, and takes only the newest of the builds which it hasn ' t seen before, so that with lucky polling those three might have produced two (but not three) talos runs, but they weren ' t that lucky</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.5">faster polling would decrease the odds of that happening, but as i understand it the poller ' s designed not to even try to test every build</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.6">the times i ' ve looked at the tracemonkey pushlog, that ' s fairly typical</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.7">average of maybe six or seven pushes a day, but tightly grouped in one or two bursts with an outlier or two, so _probably_ it wouldn ' t overload a poller that queued up more than one build per poll</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.8">probably</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="8.9">(then there ' s the question of whether cross-machine numbers are really good enough to say that if tss was 173.74 before your patch, on qm-plinux-trunk04, and 177.38 with your patch, on qm-plinux-trunk05, then that means you regressed it as opposed to meaning that trunk05 is a hair slower or had one bad run, but luckily that ' s not my problem.)</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="9.5">our goal is to test as many builds as we possibly can and to only skip builds if we are unable to get ahead</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="5.1">i want to add an additional comment</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="5.2">if i run the gnome-settings-daemon command then gtk apps show hal devices in it s file open dialog like the kde one s, but if i click on the floppy device on a gtk file picker it mounts it but doesn t change it s path, like kde, but the second time i click it, it goes to the floppy location which is what doesn t happen in kde apps</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="5.3">note that this behaviour it happenend to me sometimes with other devices in kde, so the first time that i click over it, it mounts the device but doesn t change it s path, but the second time doesn t try to mount again if it is already mounted and go to it s location</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="5.4">i think that it should be sufficient to check if the device it is already mounted and change to the mounted point, but i don t know if that it is already a hal job, so better to fix it there if is that case</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="11.1">sorry, but i disagree with that solution</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="11.2">the underlying problem is described in https://issues.kolab.org/issue3801 and https://issues.kolab.org/issue2869, this is a bug in the kolab server, it s not reporting an error when logging in without the domain name and instead just lists no folders</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="11.3">obviously, the kolab wizard has to handle that correctly by adding the domain part to the username (and it does that already)</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="11.4">but adding kolab-specific workarounds to the generic imap wizard is wrong imho</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="11.5">most non-kolab imap servers i know don t require a domain part in the username, and keep in mind that this is only about the pre-filled value in the username field anyway, in case you have a different username than the suggested default you have to edit it.</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="1.4">since kopete is a multimessenger and has the idea of metacontacts etc i don t think it s neccessary to display on which network the contact is online (because it doesn t matter), this makes even more sense if you have people who have several different accounts and irc nicks and keeping track of all of them can quite clutter the contact list, so i would simply like an option to turn of the displaying of the tiny icq/irc/etc icons right (or wherever you choose them to be) of the display name, hope this will be done any time soon, thanks for kopete it s such a great app!</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="1.13">result: when i returned to my machine, all of my 2gb of ram was claimed by amarok, the cpu was still at 100% and my swap was thrashing madly</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="1.18">at about ten bands or so selected i run out of ram again and the time waited increases exponentially as swap is terribly slow</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.19">conclusion: seems to me that amarok is trying to load every song in my collection in to ram before starting to move them</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.20">this is fine for handling small amounts of data, but makes no sense when pointed at a collection of about 100gb</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="1.8">in the video editor the files are sorted to their names</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.9">so i assume that i can sort them to date and then select them all, and press f2 to rename them</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.10">so, i get this output</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="1.27">nor does it do the silly natural name sorting</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.28">it sorts on names the posix way one other place i ran into this shortcoming of rename is when i was trying to import a range of pictures into ffmpeg to make a time-lapse movie</Sentence>

<Sentence ID="1.2">gimp-1.2 contains this symlink also, pointing to gimptool-1.2</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.3">the intention was to make gimptool convenient to use for our users</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.4">there s a problem however which is in the gimp-1.2 tree but since we can t fix it there, we should think about possible workarounds in gimp-2.0</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.5">the problem is that gimp.m4, which provides am_path_gimp(), the automake macro to check for gimp-1.2 does not use gimptool-1.2 as it should</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.6">it checks for the gimptool binary in the path and uses that</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.7">this means that if people have gimp-2.0 installed, makefiles and configure scripts written to work with gimp-1.2 start to break</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.8">the gimp-print plug-in is a prominent example</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.9">if gimp-1.2 and gimp-2.0 are installed and the gimp-print configure script is run, the script detects the presence of gimp-1.2 but uses cflags and libs from gimptool which points to gimp-2.0</Sentence>
<Sentence ID="1.10">probably the only thing we can do about this is to not install the symlink and to document that gimptool-2.0 needs to be used with gimp-2.0</Sentence>
