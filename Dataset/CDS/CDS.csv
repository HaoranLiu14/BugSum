Bug Number,Sentence Number,Sentence
110797,1.1,When I insert an audio CD it is automatically mounted and an icon for the CD is added to the desktop.
110797,1.2,When I right click on the desktop icon the top two menu items are "Open" and "Browse Folder".
110797,1.3,I ould expect ths first option to open the CD with the default CD playing software (i.e.
110797,1.4,Sound Juicer_DOUHAO_ Exaile_DOUHAO_ Beep etc).
110797,1.5,I would expect the "Browse Folder" option to open the disc using the default file manager (Nautilus_DOUHAO_ Konqueror_DOUHAO_ Thunar etc).
110797,1.6,However it doesn't matter which of these options I choose as both invoke Sound Juicer which is not what I want - In this particular instance I am actually trying to find out what the mount point of the CD is so I can copy and paste the value into grip as I have given up on trying to get an MP3 profile set up using "gnome-audio-profiles-properties" (NO matter what I set Sound Juicer refuses to load the profile).
110797,1.7,This happens every time I insert an Audio CD and it is most annoying.
110797,1.8,As an additional point I would like to see the properties page for all desktop icons amended to include the full filesystem path for the item being displayed.
110797,1.9,In the case of a shortcut this should show both the full path of the shortcut and the full path of the target.
110797,1.10,This text should also be "copy & pastable" (in fact every piece of text that is ever displayed on any widget should be "copy & pastable" but that's an entirely different gripe of mine with all "modern" operating systems.
110797,1.11,Cheers.
110797,2.1,Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better.
110797,2.2,You reported this bug a while ago and there hasn't been any activity in recently.
110797,2.3,We were wondering if this is still an issue for you?
110797,2.4,Thanks in advance.
110797,3.1,Sorry for the delay in replyin but I haven't looked at "my" bugs for a while.
110797,3.2,But yes the behaviour is still "broken".
110797,3.3,As I originally said it would seem logical to me that "Open" should invoke the default player/ripper for an audio CD and "Browse" should invoke the default File Mangler (sorry "Manager").
110797,3.4,Under Gutsy both actions still invoke "Sound Juicer".
110797,3.5,If both menu items are going to perform the same action there is no point having two menu items (as one would suffice).
110797,3.6,If they are supposed to do different things then they should (otherwise there is no point in them being here !)
110797,4.1,I_DOUHAO_ too_DOUHAO_ cannot get the default audio player to activate when I insert an audio CD.
110797,4.2,I set Preferences > Preferred Applications > Multimedia to "/usr/bin/amarok --cdplay %d" but Rhythmbox still came up.
110797,4.3,So_DOUHAO_ I uninstalled Rhythmbox and then Banshee came up when I inserted an audio CD.
110797,4.4,So_DOUHAO_ I uninstalled Banshee and now Sound Juicer comes up.
110797,4.5,How do I set the audio player of my choice to start when an audio CD is inserted?
110797,5.1,I've tested this behavior by inserting an Audio CD into my Intrepid Ibex system and observed that right clicking the desktop icon allows me to "Open" the CD via a music player and "Browse" invokes Nautilus.
110797,5.2,Subsequently_DOUHAO_ I am setting this bug to Fix Released.
110797,5.3,Retromingent - your question is best addressed at the http://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/ .
110797,5.4,Thanks!
110797,6.1,Brian_DOUHAO_ I don't think you are fully understanding the problem here.
110797,6.2,There isn't an easy to find way for the end user to set an audio player default that is different than the three "approved" applications (Sound Juicer_DOUHAO_ Rhythmbox_DOUHAO_ and Banshee) in Ubuntu.
110797,6.3,Yes_DOUHAO_ you said that you could right click on the audio cd and are then presented with the choice to " 'Open' the CD via _A_ player' (my emphasis).
110797,6.4,The problem is that there is no option to choose another player.
110797,6.5,You are only allowed to use So the user might try to go under Preferred Applications and the Multimedia tab as this is where it was handled in previous releases of Ubuntu and the moniker "Preferred Applications" appears to fit the intent of what the user wants to do (as Retromingent points out).
110797,6.6,It turns out that you can set the default multimedia handling properties of Gnome under Nautilus.
110797,6.7,Just Open Nautilus (Places -> Home from the top Panel)_DOUHAO_ then Edit -> Preferences -> Media tab.
110797,6.8,Here you can choose how to handle media_DOUHAO_ but ONLY with Sound Juicer_DOUHAO_ Rhythmbox_DOUHAO_ or Banshee (if it is installed).
110797,6.9,There is no option to configure the use of another player AND this isn't the most logical (for the average user) place to configure this behavior.
110797,6.10,One more thing that compounds the problem is the Ubuntu Help pages (in Hardy at least) state the following with regards to this issue: "When you insert an audio CD_DOUHAO_ the Sound Juicer CD player and ripper opens automatically.
110797,6.11,If you are connected to the Internet_DOUHAO_ Sound Juicer will display the CD artist_DOUHAO_ album and track names.
110797,6.12,To play the CD_DOUHAO_ click the Play button or press Ctrl+P.
110797,6.13,To play a particular track_DOUHAO_ double-click on the track or select the track and click Play.
110797,6.14,As an alternative to Sound Juicer_DOUHAO_ the Rhythmbox Music Player is also able to play CDs.
110797,6.15,Simply insert a CD_DOUHAO_ ignore or close Sound Juicer_DOUHAO_ start Rhythmbox and double-click the audio CD item in the Devices list." The last paragraph is terrible advice.
110797,6.16,If Ubuntu stands for the idea that it is the Linux for human beings (and I fully believe that it is).
110797,6.17,We should look at the idea that a person should ignore the automatically started program (Sound Juicer) and then start another program when they want to listen to a CD as fundamentally anti-user.
110797,6.18,And I honestly think that the only reason that the documentation is written that way_DOUHAO_ is because the instructions for setting an alternative action for CD audio (even for just the approved actions) is convoluted and unintuitive and therefor broken with regards to the central premise of Ubuntu.
110797,6.19,Beyond that_DOUHAO_ there should be an easily identifiable way for the average user to add to the list of applications that can handle removable media.
110797,6.20,As far as I can tell_DOUHAO_ there isn't one.
110797,7.1,I contend that if these problems still exist in Intrepid Ibex_DOUHAO_ that a fix has not yet been released.
110797,8.1,Jim J - This bug report was originally about "Open" and "Browse Folder" behaving in the same way_DOUHAO_ which they don't in Intrepid Ibex which is why I closed the bug report.
110797,8.2,Retromingent's wasn't specifically about the original issue this bug report was about.
110797,8.3,However_DOUHAO_ the "Media Handling" tab in Nautilus's preferences allows one to choose "Open with other Application" which I think qualifies as another player.
110797,8.4,Issues with the Ubuntu Help pages should be filed as bugs about the 'ubuntu-docs' project.
110797,9.1,Thanks_DOUHAO_ Brian_DOUHAO_ I will do that.
110797,9.2,It is nice to see that Ibex will have an Open with other Application.
110797,9.3,I appreciate your clarifications.

114730,1.2,aide Version 0.13.1-5 _DOUHAO_ ubuntu 7.10 (gutsy)
114730,1.3,Daily AIDE Report says: ---8<---- premature termination - Daily AIDE report for $HOSTNAME The cron job was terminated because lock /var/run/aide/cron.daily.lock could not be obtained.
114730,1.4,---8<---
114730,1.5,Creating /var/run/aide/ and changing ownership via: sudo mkdir /var/run/aide sudo chmod root:adm /var/run/aide
114730,1.6,This only works untill the next reboot.
114730,1.7,After a reboot the directory /var/run/aide is missing again.
114730,1.8,TESTCASE 1.
114730,1.9,install aide 2.
114730,1.10,reboot system 3.
114730,1.11,manually invoke the aide cron job: $ sudo /etc/cron.daily/aide if the cronjob aborts right away_DOUHAO_ then the test has failed.
114730,2.1,The problem is in /etc/cron.daily/aide after line 39 TMPBASE="/var/run/aide" add: if [ ?
114730,2.2,-d $TMPBASE ] ; then # TMPBASE does not exist_DOUHAO_ create it mkdir $TMPBASE; fi Or patch it with the attached aide.patch
114730,3.1,Setting of restrictive file permissions would be also a good thing.
114730,4.1,This has been fixed in 0.13.1 Thanks for your report and feel free to submit any new bug.
114730,5.1,Hello_DOUHAO_ I am running a server on Hardy_DOUHAO_ with the 0.13.1-8 version of Aide_DOUHAO_ and I still get this mail.
114730,6.1,Storm_DOUHAO_ this is strange because the directory /var/run/aide is created during install by the postinst script.
114730,6.2,Can you check if /var/run/aide/ exists on your system ?
114730,7.1,No_DOUHAO_ I have to create it_DOUHAO_ and if I reboot my computer_DOUHAO_ I have to do this again.
114730,7.2,Furthemore_DOUHAO_ sometimes directory is deleted whereas I don't shutdown my computer :s I may narrow that I have done an update from a Dapper system_DOUHAO_ with its version of Aide (I don't remember its version number).
114730,8.1,Am Do_DOUHAO_ 17.

114730,8.5,I added a test for the /var/run/aide directory to /etc/cron.daily/aide ---8<--- TMPBASE="/var/run/aide" if [ ?
114730,8.6,-d $TMPBASE ] ; then # TMPBASE does not exist_DOUHAO_ create it mkdir $TMPBASE; fi LOCKFILE="$TMPBASE/cron.daily.lock" ---8<--- regards_DOUHAO_ thomas
114730,9.1,I'm marking it back to confirmed because even if the /var/run/aide directory is created during install_DOUHAO_ there are cases where it doesn't exist anymore at run time.
114730,9.2,I haven't found how this could happen but the proposed patch is harmless.
114730,10.1,Here is the debdiff to fix this issue.
114730,11.1,@Jean-Baptiste: The reason /var/run/aide no longer exists after rebooting is that in 8.04_DOUHAO_ /var/run is mounted as a tmpfs filesystem and has no backing store on disk.
114730,11.2,It would be great if we could roll this fix into the SRU update for aide that includes bug 157858 as well.
114730,11.3,Thanks!
114730,13.1,I briefly reviewed the debdiff and it seems that the script will hit 'cantcreatebase' if the directory does exist.
114730,13.2,Jean-Baptiste_DOUHAO_ can you comment/update the patch?

114730,14.3,I thought that too_DOUHAO_ but then both experimentation and the mkdir(1) manpage showed that mkdir -p won't return an error if the directory already exists (it will for other problems_DOUHAO_ such as EPERM).
114730,14.4,-- Steve Beattie <email address hidden> http://NxNW.org/~steve/
114730,15.1,So it does.
114730,15.2,Thanks Steve.
114730,15.3,Good work Jean-Baptiste.
114730,15.4,I have just now uploaded this to Intrepid.
114730,15.5,Thanks!
114730,16.1,Jean-Baptiste_DOUHAO_ can you also file a bug with Debian following https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Upstream ?
114730,16.2,This will benefit Debian users with a tmpfs /var/run_DOUHAO_ as well as minimize out delta.
114730,16.3,Thanks!
114730,17.1,I'm sorry not coming back earlier.
114730,17.2,I've been quite busy.
114730,17.3,I've reported it there http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=501848
114730,19.1,Accepted into -proposed_DOUHAO_ please test and give feedback here.
114730,19.2,Please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/EnableProposed for documentation how to enable and use -proposed.
114730,19.3,Thank you in advance!
114730,20.1,According to Jamie's comment this is fixed in intrepid.
114730,20.2,Please reopen if not.
114730,21.1,Successfully verified hardy-proposed: 0.13.1-8ubuntu1 in hardy-updates No /var/run/aide/ is present after package installation and reboot.
114730,21.2,0.13.1-8ubuntu3 in hardy-proposed The /var/run/aide/ directory now exists following installation and the directory is successfully recreated by the cron.daily/aide job.
114730,22.1,The fix for this in aide 0.13.1-8ubuntu3 has now been released in hardy-updates; marking as closed as the changelog had a typo for the bugnumber so this bug wasn't automatically closed
11615,1.1,If I insert an audio CD_DOUHAO_ gnome-cd runs automatically and plays the CD just fine.
11615,1.2,However if I start it from the menu_DOUHAO_ it is unable to access the device and says "Drive error".
11615,1.3,If I go into the preferences_DOUHAO_ it is detecting the CD device correctly.
11615,1.4,If I create a /dev/cdrom link to the actual device (/dev/hdc)_DOUHAO_ this fixes the problem and gnome-cd works as it should_DOUHAO_ but surely it should be able to detect and work with /dev/hdc?

11615,16.2,seems there is some issue in the gst-paranoia a quick pipeline in gst-editor played back the cd in the same disturbed way.
11615,16.3,is there a bug in gst-paranoia with ide-cdrom interface ?
11615,16.4,tried kernel 2.6.10-5 and 2.6.12-3.3 may be ky laptops sis630 chipset or the old toshiba slimline dvd-rom SD-C2502 won't work properly and conflict with soundcard
11615,17.1,the issue exists also with released gnome-media 2.6.12 are there any previous patches gone into nirvana?

11636,7.3,The question was asked on the isdn4linux mailinglist (at least) four times already without any reply.
11636,7.4,I think we should go with dokos new binary-only "offical" avm drivers.
11636,7.5,I tested them and they work for me(tm).

11636,8.1,Ok i think it is wise to drop the mISDN completely since upstream is dead.
11636,8.2,Reasons: a) upstream is dead b) we cannot commit something that it is already broken c) it can be replaced by the binary drivers.
11636,8.3,Matt?

11636,9.7,If it is unsupported upstream_DOUHAO_ it must be removed.
11636,9.8,How did it get added to our kernel in the first place if upstream is dead?
11636,10.1,port-forwarded from warty_DOUHAO_
11636,11.1,Fixed in 2.6.10-10 that will be available soon in the archive.
11636,12.1,that's a misunderstanding a) it's not dead upstream b) currently building with misdn-2005-02-25 to check for the failures c) it supports hardware_DOUHAO_ that is not supported by the proprietary avm drivers reopening the report
11636,13.1,Created an attachment (id=1541) patch_DOUHAO_ enabling mISDN_DOUHAO_ disabling avmfritz
11636,14.1,the attached patch - updates mISDN to a recent snapshot - enables the build of the mISDN modules - doesn't build the avmfritz module the oops is still reproducible with the snapshot_DOUHAO_ however it works without problems with the hfcpci driver.
11636,14.2,the change is local one_DOUHAO_ please consider it after the preview release.
11636,15.1,Is this bug still present in Breezy?
11636,16.1,We don't ship misdn in current breezy/dapper.
12079,1.1,The battery state of my notebook (Acer Travelmate 4000LMi) is not shown because it needs another driver (the standard acpi driver doesn't support the interface for the Smart Battery System).
12079,1.2,You can find a driver for it (two modules and a kernel patch) at http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=6354144&forum_id=6102
12079,1.3,I hope it will be included in Ubuntu soon.

12079,2.1,Hi Matthew_DOUHAO_ i saw you are partecipating in the discussion mentioned in the bug.
12079,2.2,What is the status for this driver?
12079,2.3,(aka is it safe for inclusion?)
12079,3.1,Probably_DOUHAO_ but currently there's no userspace support.
12079,3.2,gnome-battery-applet will need a patch to support smart batteries as well as control method ones.
12079,4.1,(In reply to comment #2)
12079,4.2,> Probably_DOUHAO_ but currently there's no userspace support.
12079,4.3,gnome-battery-applet will > need a patch to support smart batteries as well as control method ones.
12079,4.4,I've not tested the patch but the author of the patch says that the driver also supports the standard acpi interface in /proc/acpi/battery (the old module of acpi has to be unloaded before loading the new driver).
12079,4.5,He only recommends to use the new interface because it also supports the special features of smart batteries.
12079,5.1,The legacy interface is only available if the control method battery support isn't built.
12079,5.2,Most machines have a control method battery_DOUHAO_ so we need to ship with that switched on.
12079,6.1,(In reply to comment #4)
12079,6.2,> The legacy interface is only available if the control method battery support > isn't built.
12079,6.3,Most machines have a control method battery_DOUHAO_ so we need to ship > with that switched on.
12079,6.4,Yes_DOUHAO_ I thought it would be possible to unload the legacy modules to get the legacy interface of sbs working.
12079,6.5,But it seems that also as unloaded but installed modules both drivers conflict if sbs uses the legacy interface.
12079,7.1,For what i can read and understand this is not ready for inclusion.
12079,7.2,It will wait after hoary and when the driver will be included in the standard kernel.
12079,8.1,(In reply to comment #6)
12079,8.2,> For what i can read and understand this is not ready for inclusion.
12079,8.3,> It will wait after hoary and when the driver will be included in the standard > kernel.
12079,8.4,I disagree.
12079,8.5,I think acpi-sbs should be included but without support for the legacy interface.
12079,8.6,It's possible to see the battery state in /proc/acpi/sbs.
12079,8.7,That isn't user-friendly but better than nothing.
12079,8.8,And if there is a better interface available in future_DOUHAO_ you can install and use it without patching the default hoary kernel.
120833,1.1,The default URL handler installed with the urlview package uses www-browser as a first attempt at running a browser to handle a HTTP URL.
120833,1.2,The problem with this approach is that www-browser always corresponds with the system-wide default browser_DOUHAO_ even if the user has set the BROWSER environment variable.
120833,1.3,On the other hand_DOUHAO_ sensible-browser respects the user's configuration_DOUHAO_ and runs the program indicated by the BROWSER environment variable.
120833,1.4,In my case_DOUHAO_ I have BROWSER set to w3m_DOUHAO_ and a friend installed elinks on the system.
120833,1.5,Suddenly_DOUHAO_ urlview started running elinks for me instead of w3m.
120833,1.6,I shouldn't have to change the system-wide configuration to fix this_DOUHAO_ should I?
120833,1.7,In some cases_DOUHAO_ I might not have access.
120833,1.8,Things would be better if urlview respected $BROWSER.
120833,2.1,Someone should change this to wishlist.
120833,3.1,I don't believe this should be wishlist.
120833,3.2,Not respecting user preferences is a defect.
120833,5.1,man 1 urlview: The BROWSER environment variable is honored only if the rc-file doesn’t contain the COMMAND option.
120833,6.1,Hi Emanuele_DOUHAO_ Thanks for your attention to this issue.
120833,6.2,I hope you won't mind if I attempt to defend my position: This is a usability issue with the default configuration that would be easy to fix.
120833,6.3,Using sensible-browser is standard practice for Debian systems_DOUHAO_ and saves users from having to customize configuration files for every package out there that might want to launch a WWW browser.
120833,6.4,Mentioning the bug in the man page doesn't make it not a bug_DOUHAO_ does it?
120833,6.5,The default configuration should either use sensible-browser_DOUHAO_ or not specify COMMAND at all_DOUHAO_ for the sake of honoring user preferences.
120833,7.1,Hi_DOUHAO_ I'm happy to hear your opinion.
120833,7.2,:-) $BROWSER is not ignored.
120833,7.3,You can override it through the COMMAND configuration option_DOUHAO_ which can be placed in the configuration file (global or per-user)_DOUHAO_ and that's clearly stated in the man page.
120833,7.4,http://bugs.debian.org/212789 explains why this logic has been introduced.
120833,7.5,Probably the confusing thing is just that the default config file provided by the Debian package specifies COMMAND.
120833,7.6,If you think so_DOUHAO_ I can upload a new revision with COMMAND commented out.
120833,7.7,Let me know.
120833,8.1,Hi_DOUHAO_ $BROWSER is conditionally ignored_DOUHAO_ and the condition is that COMMAND is set in the config file.
120833,8.2,It is set by default_DOUHAO_ so BROWSER is ignored by default.
120833,8.3,More importantly: I don't think that COMMAND should be commented by default.
120833,8.4,I think it should be set to sensible-browser by default.
120833,8.5,More importantly_DOUHAO_ I still haven't heard a reason _not_ to use sensible-browser instead of www-browser as the default for COMMAND.
120833,8.6,I believe using sensible-browser not only solves my issue_DOUHAO_ but also addresses those issues raised at http://bugs.debian.org/212789 .

120833,9.6,Sounds reasonable.
120833,9.7,I'll upload to Debian sid a new revision of urlview which uses sensible browser rather than {x-_DOUHAO_}www-browser in url_handler.sh_DOUHAO_ without changing the default global config file.

123848,12.1,When you use the restricted driver manager to enable the nvidia driver it adds the needed options to xorg.conf for you.
123848,12.2,If you choose to manually enable the nvidia driver you also have to manually add these options to make compiz work.
123848,12.3,Closing bug as invalid_DOUHAO_ is user error.
123848,13.1,i don't think so travis.
123848,13.2,i had used the restricted driver manager to enable my nvidia drivers.
123848,13.3,or "maybe" it is/was a bug in restricted driver manager from tribe 1 and previous dailies.
123848,13.4,because i remember i used tribe 1 to install gutsy.
123848,13.5,i believe that with the new updates to the restricted driver manager it only checks if the driver is enable or not.
123848,13.6,and not if all the lines where actually added to xorg.conf try to check on that.

123848,14.1,I just used the restricted drivers manager to disable and re-enable my nvidia driver_DOUHAO_ and it did add those two lines to the xorg.conf file.
123848,14.2,Interestingly_DOUHAO_ though it added the lines to the Device section_DOUHAO_ whereas the info I found online suggested I add the lines to the Screen section.
123848,14.3,I'm not sure which is correct_DOUHAO_ but both appear to work.
123848,14.4,As to this particular bug_DOUHAO_ however_DOUHAO_ I still think it's a valid bug.
123848,14.5,Compiz should not segfault -- ever -- for any reason.
123848,14.6,A better solution would be to recommend to the user that those two lines should be added to the xorg.conf file.
123848,14.7,An ever nicer solution would be to offer to add the lines to the file so the user doesn't have to.
123848,15.1,It's still a bug.
123848,16.1,Fix committed upstream_DOUHAO_ just need to get a new snapshot made.
123848,17.1,I can confirm that adding the two lines to xorg.conf fixes the crashing issue.
123848,17.2,To fix this bug_DOUHAO_ isn't it possible to have apt-get run "sudo nvidia-xconfig --add-argb-glx-visuals -d 24" after installing the nvidia-glx and nvidia-glx-new drivers in synaptics?
123848,17.3,Since Restricted driver manger already does this_DOUHAO_ we only need to cover the synaptics/apt-get way of installing the drivers.
123848,17.4,I agree with a previous post who said that compiz should never crash period.
123848,19.1,shouldnt this be open until the fix is set in by default as opposed to modifying a file?

13175,3.1,I don't think this is gnome problem_DOUHAO_ I think its a linux kernel problem.
13175,3.2,I've just recently bought a new computer and have installed ubuntu on it_DOUHAO_ and have the same problem.
13175,3.3,The modem doesn't connect at more than 9600baud the first few times you connect.
13175,3.4,It exactly the same problem that I had on debian with kernel 2.4.27.
13175,3.5,This was fixed by debian in the 2.4.27-8 release_DOUHAO_ which removed some debian kernel patches.
13175,3.6,Its documented in debian bug #286402 .
13175,3.7,http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=286402 My ubuntu is using 2.6.10-5 kernel and I think it might have similar (debian) patches_DOUHAO_ which may have been backported into 2.4.27 which cause my debian problems.
13175,3.8,The temporary fix is to run "sudo stty -F /dev/ttyS0 speed 115200" TWO TIMES before starting dialup.
13175,4.1,I uploaded a new gnome-system-tools and system-tools-backends into breezy.
13175,4.2,It will set the serial speed to 115200.
13175,4.3,does that help?
13175,5.1,The problem should be fixed with the current breezy version of gnome-system-tools and I haven't got any more reports about the problem for some time.

13613,6.7,It is a small box with a laptop like CD rom (disk snaps onto a center thing)_DOUHAO_ but it is a P2 cpu_DOUHAO_ so I would hope it is a standard ATAPI.
13613,6.8,seems to be: $ grep ATAPI sahara.dmesg.txt hdc: UJDA110_DOUHAO_ ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive hdc: ATAPI 14X CD-ROM drive_DOUHAO_ 128kB Cache

13613,10.1,No reply in almost 9 months_DOUHAO_ closing bug.
13613,10.2,Please reopen if the bug is still there with Breezy/Dapper iso's burnt at low speed.
13655,1.1,Installed Hoary yesterday (7/3-05)_DOUHAO_ and updated everything.
13655,1.2,After first installing the nvidia drivers they worked fine_DOUHAO_ but after a reboot it didn't.
13655,1.3,Doing a "modprobe nvidia"_DOUHAO_ solved the problem.
13655,1.4,I did a "update-rc.d mymodules defaults" with mymodules just containing "modprobe nvidia"; this also fixes the problem.
13655,1.5,I had to follow this procedure in Warty also.
13655,1.6,Cheers
13655,2.1,If I'm not mistaken_DOUHAO_ nvidia-glx contains a script which handles all of this for you (loading the module_DOUHAO_ configuring X_DOUHAO_ etc).
13655,3.1,nvidia-glx does not configure a great deal as far as I can tell_DOUHAO_ I still had to comment out dri and change nv to nvidia_DOUHAO_ in xorg.conf It does load the module at installation because ctrl-alt-backspace gave me the nvidia screen.
13655,3.2,It was after I rebooted the module didn't not get loaded.
13655,3.3,The script could also add Option "RenderAccel" "True" to the device section_DOUHAO_ without hurting anybody_DOUHAO_
13655,4.1,When you run nvidia-glx-config enable_DOUHAO_ does the kernel driver not get updated?
13655,4.2,This is the documented procedure_DOUHAO_ and seems to work fine here.
13655,5.1,(In reply to comment #3)
13655,5.2,> When you run nvidia-glx-config enable_DOUHAO_ does the kernel driver not get updated?
13655,5.3,> This is the documented procedure_DOUHAO_ and seems to work fine here.
13655,5.4,mikkel@bitsplitter:~$ sudo nvidia-glx-config enable Error: your X configuration has been altered.
13655,5.5,This script cannot proceed automatically.
13655,5.6,If you believe that this not correct_DOUHAO_ you can update the md5sum entry executing the following command: md5sum /etc/X11/xorg.conf | sudo tee /var/lib/xfree86/xorg.conf.md5sum otherwise edit manually /etc/X11/xorg.conf to change the Driver section from nv to nvidia.
13655,5.7,I've added RenderAccel to my device section AFTER installation_DOUHAO_ so that explains this output_DOUHAO_ but not the missing nvidia entry in /etc/modules.
13655,5.8,I've looked through the nvidia-glx-config script and it looks very sane.
13655,5.9,Are you guys sure it gets run on installation?
13655,5.10,I've heard about a bunch of guys in the fora that had to manually add nvidia to /etc/modules _DOUHAO_ Maybe the script also ought to comment out dri to use glx?
13655,6.1,No_DOUHAO_ it is not run in post-install: installing the driver does not automatically force it upon you.
13655,6.2,http://www.ubuntu.com/wiki/BinaryDriverHowto is the documented way to install these drivers_DOUHAO_ which includes running nvidia-glx-config.
13655,6.3,This is fine for most people.
13655,7.1,My bad.
13655,7.2,It even says that i have to run "sudo nvidia-glx-config enable" in the package description.
13655,7.3,Is there no way to emphasise this fact for the retarded ones of us out here?
13655,7.4,To cling on (Star Trek pun intended) to my last remaining remnants of a point_DOUHAO_ I still think that nvidia-glx-config should disable dri and set RenderAccel to True.
13655,8.1,Valid point for dri_DOUHAO_ but I don't think RenderAccel should be set to true by default; when it's safe to enable by default_DOUHAO_ nVidia will enable it by default.
13655,8.2,I'll sort the Load "dri" thing out later.
13960,1.1,In Hoary_DOUHAO_ whenever I drag a desktop icon somewhere_DOUHAO_ a strange-looking white border appears on the left-hand side of my screen.
13960,1.2,This should not be happening_DOUHAO_ as it looks very strange.
13960,2.1,It indicates that the desktop is a valid drop target.
13960,2.2,However_DOUHAO_ as an affordance for this_DOUHAO_ it's slightly over the top.
13960,2.3,Seb_DOUHAO_ how do you feel about special-casing this out_DOUHAO_ just for the desktop window?
13960,3.1,upstreams have discussed about this and decided to keep it in this way_DOUHAO_ I don't think we should change that.
13960,4.1,OK - so it looks like this will remain as-is.
13960,4.2,Closing.
13960,5.1,No_DOUHAO_ this won't remain as-is - I've discussed it with Alex_DOUHAO_ and he agrees that as it stands_DOUHAO_ the effect looks like a bug.
13960,5.2,Seb_DOUHAO_ can we fix this easily enough for hoary's Nautilus?
13960,6.1,I don't think that the effect is weird but I'll fix it
13960,7.1,This upload fixes it: nautilus (2.10.0-0ubuntu4) hoary; urgency=low .

141342,1.1,Cliff suggests a feature to start Coccinella minimized in the system tray.
141342,1.2,See http://coccinella.im/node/98
141342,1.3,PS: * I would place this option in the same place as the "Login on Coccinella startup" option.
141342,1.4,* Maybe call this option: "Login minimized in system tray" (at least on KDE_DOUHAO_ maybe replace "system tray" to how it is called on the system).
141342,2.1,oops_DOUHAO_ typo
141342,3.1,Just added code to detect if quit was made from a minimized state_DOUHAO_ in which case it is started in minimized state as well.

14286,10.3,Well_DOUHAO_ it happens every time I log into Gnome_DOUHAO_ so I guess that Gnome/mixer does not save and restore mixer settings.
14286,11.1,> Well_DOUHAO_ it happens every time I log into Gnome_DOUHAO_ so I guess that Gnome/mixer does > not save and restore mixer settings.
14286,11.2,It sounds as if GNOME is restoring or setting mixer levels to stupid values.
14286,11.3,In that case this bug report needs to be assigned to the relevant GNOME package.
14286,12.1,I don't think that GNOME saves or restores mixer settings_DOUHAO_ but it's possible that they are being changed in unexpected ways when the user adjusts the mixer controls_DOUHAO_

14286,14.4,Do you mean by this "_DOUHAO_ every time I boot the machine and log in"?
14286,14.5,If so then the problem is that the sound levels of the USB headset are not being initialised to sane values or saved-and-restored on boot.

14286,15.4,Yes_DOUHAO_ that is what I mean.
14286,15.5,I have examined it more and found that it only happens when I boot and log into Gnome.

14526,1.1,the cmedia Azalia chipset is not supported with the current 1.08 alsa version.
14526,1.2,I do not have sound.
14526,1.3,Read somewhere this is a known bug in alsa 1.08.
14526,1.4,plz advice
14526,2.1,We will be updating alsa after hoary is released.
14526,3.1,My system id: ab63fefcd31000e0b4c0dfbd8d7c695d I had the same problem.
14526,3.2,I just grabbed the alsa source package_DOUHAO_ compiled it and now it works.
14526,3.3,The issue is that the snd-az kernel module is not installed by default _DOUHAO_ I don't know why becuase compiling ALSA with the default configure installs this module.
14526,3.4,So_DOUHAO_ to fix this_DOUHAO_ just ship the snd-az kernel module with the default install.
14526,3.5,I Don't think any alsa update is required because I just compiled the source package of 1.08 available from the normal ubuntu package manager.

14526,4.1,This is fixed with breezy.
161649,1.1,Some of our clients wanted the week to begin on Sunday_DOUHAO_ others on Monday (using the plone portlet calendar).
161649,1.2,Here is a quick fix_DOUHAO_ could be seen as feature?
161649,1.3,You can set the first day of week from the configureCalendarTool view.
161649,1.4,Hope this helps!
161649,1.5,Jeff
161649,3.1,Uploaded: firstDayWeek2.diff Wrong diff_DOUHAO_ sorry Better consider this one!
161649,4.1,Please use a unified diff_DOUHAO_ and in the correct order.
161649,5.1,I'm afraid the patch is unusable.
161649,5.2,If you look at the code in the Calendar Tool you will notice that it relies on the first day of week setting known to Python's "calendar" module and not on a simple instance attribute on the CalendarTool class.
161649,5.3,While your patch may look like "it does the job" for you it is likely that it will introduce all kinds of problems since you now decouple the first day of week as known to the calendar module and the first day of the week setting as known to those pieces that would use your new attribute directly.
161649,5.4,A true fix would have to involve calling calendar.setfirstweekday with the new value upon changing it from the ZMI_DOUHAO_ but also re-setting that value every single time Zope is started because the calendar module won't persist any value you might have told it about during the last run_DOUHAO_ it resets itself to whatever default it uses.
161649,5.5,Unit tests are needed as well.

161649,7.2,Unusable ?
161649,7.3,But it works here?!
161649,7.4,> If you look at the code in the Calendar > Tool you will notice that it relies on the first day of week setting > known to Python's "calendar" module and not on a simple instance > attribute on the CalendarTool class.
161649,7.5,I know that_DOUHAO_ that's why you have to set it each time you call the calendar module_DOUHAO_ I did it in the method i needed but you can use the same call in other method if you need to return an ordered list of days in weeks.
161649,7.6,> While your patch may look like "it > does the job" for you it is likely that it will introduce all kinds of > problems since you now decouple the first day of week as known to the > calendar module > and the first day of the week setting as known to those > pieces that would use your new attribute directly.
161649,7.7,i dont think its known by the module_DOUHAO_ Call the calendar.setfirstweekday(self.getFirstWeekDay()) in each method that need something in relation with ordered days in weeks.
161649,7.8,> A true fix would have to involve calling calendar.setfirstweekday with > the new value upon changing it from the ZMI_DOUHAO_ > but also re-setting that > value every single time Zope is started because the calendar module won't > persist any value you might have told it about during the last run_DOUHAO_ it > resets itself to whatever default it uses.
161649,7.9,Then you shouldnt call the calendar module anymore but a instanciated class which use the calendar and you will have it persistant _DOUHAO_ Or just create method like getCalendar() which will return you the module calendar with the firstweekday setting_DOUHAO_
161649,7.10,Ok maybe my code isn't right but I mean hardcode calendar.setfirstweekday(6) isn't a solution and should be able to set it outside the code.
161649,7.11,You are right I was a bit too confident by writting Feature And Solution.
161649,7.12,> Unit tests are needed as well.
161649,7.13,Will think about it next time :)
161649,8.1,Status: Pending => Resolved This is now implemented_DOUHAO_ including unit tests_DOUHAO_ on the 2.0 branch and the trunk.
16670,1.1,When I try to adjust the play back volume via the volume applet_DOUHAO_ nothing happens.
16670,1.2,Turning all the way up or all the way down has no effect what so ever.
16670,1.3,If I change volume from inside Rhythbox or Totem it works fine.
16670,1.4,Adjusting PCM from the volume control (right click applet -> "Open Volume Control") also works fine.
16670,1.5,Sometimes I'm not even allowed to adjust the slider in the applet.
16670,1.6,It just returns to it's original position immediately.
16670,1.7,My Soundcard is a VIA1612A.
16670,1.8,"lsmod | grep via" gives me:
16670,1.9,Cheers!
16670,2.1,do you use hoary?
16670,2.2,what mixer/channel is configured for the applet (you can set than from the right click menu/preferences)
16670,3.1,I've tried using both OSS and ALSA in the VolApplet->Prefs.
16670,3.2,dialog.
16670,3.3,My System->Prefs->Multimedia Sys.
16670,3.4,Sel.
16670,3.5,is set to ALSA.
16670,3.6,I went to VolApplet->Open Vol.
16670,3.7,Ctrl.
16670,3.8,and discovered that it was still using OSS.
16670,3.9,Changing this to ALSA I got a partial succes.
16670,3.10,Changing Master still had no effect_DOUHAO_ but adjusting the Headphone channel did effect the volume.
16670,3.11,So now I've just pointed the applet to adjust the Headphone channel.
16670,3.12,This have been working in the past_DOUHAO_ in I'm quite sure I haven't touched the wiring_DOUHAO_ Anyways the jackstick I'm using now is the only one on the card I'm able to get any sound from.
16670,3.13,A point: Maybe System->Prefs->Multimedia Sys.
16670,3.14,Sel.
16670,3.15,should govern the behavior of the various system-section in the vol.
16670,3.16,applet?
16670,3.17,Right now there's three places to set it.
16670,3.18,In the Media Selector_DOUHAO_ The Applet->Vol Ctrl.
16670,3.19,and Applet->Prefs.
16670,4.1,does changing "master" with alsamixer works?
16670,5.1,No.
16670,5.2,Only the Headphone in alsa_DOUHAO_ seems to make a difference.
16670,6.1,By the way_DOUHAO_ my soundcard is an onboard VIA Technologies VT8233/A/8235/8237 AC97 Audio Controller If it matters
16670,7.1,thanks.
16670,7.2,reassigning to alsa since it does the same with alsamixer
16670,8.1,I don't think this has anything to do with ALSA.
16670,8.2,I am using a first generation SoundBlaster Live?
16670,8.3,and the OSS emu10k1 driver.
16670,8.4,The ALSA driver produces "scratchy" sound so I load the emu10k1 driver manually via `/etc/modules.conf`.
16670,8.5,Any way_DOUHAO_ I am having the same problem with the volume applet.
16670,8.6,I can left click the applet to bring up the volume slider_DOUHAO_ scroll the mouse wheel and watch it sort "try" to change positions.
16670,8.7,Looking at the preferences for the applet I see that the correct audio driver is selected but there are not any "tracks" to control.
16670,8.8,If I remove the applet and re-add it to the panel I can then view the preferences and the tracks are there to select.
16670,8.9,However_DOUHAO_ as soon as I either lock the applet's position or try to use the slider it "forgets" how to adjust the volume and the tracks are gone from the preferences.
16670,8.10,I am using Ubuntu 5.04.
16670,9.1,I suspect the reporter of this bug either has his computer permanently plugged in to stereo or headphones_DOUHAO_ or has a computer with some kind of internal speaker output but no actual speakers.
16670,9.2,I was hit by this bug when i upgraded to Hoary.
16670,9.3,I can no longer use my volume keys on the laptop unless i'm using the internal speakers on my laptop.
16670,9.4,It did work in Warty.
16670,9.5,No sane person would use the internal speakers_DOUHAO_ they're really crappy_DOUHAO_ so in effect i have no working volume keys.
16670,9.6,The problem is that when you plug something in the headphone socket_DOUHAO_ the internal speakers are disabled.
16670,9.7,Since the master only affects the speakers_DOUHAO_ not the headphone output_DOUHAO_ the master volume control is disabled too.
16670,9.8,Under ALSA i can change the applet to target the "Headphone" output instead_DOUHAO_ but under OSS there is no master volume control at all in this situation.
16670,9.9,There is no way to make the shortcut buttons work as they insist on changing the ALSA Master channel.
16670,9.10,Making the shortcut keys change the same channel as the volume applet would work around this bug for me_DOUHAO_ and seems like the right thing overall.
16670,9.11,However_DOUHAO_ it would still mean that the user would have to change the preferences each time he plugged in a couple of headphones.
16670,9.12,So the ideal thing would be to have one single channel for both headphone and speakers_DOUHAO_ at least on laptops (i've never seen a laptop that does not disable the builtin speakers when headphones are plugged in).
16670,9.13,I don't know why Warty worked.
16670,9.14,Either the Master did affect the output_DOUHAO_ or the shortcut keys respected the setting in the volume applet.
16670,9.15,I have a Dell Latitude D800 with an audio device my system identifies as Intel 82801DB-ICH4_DOUHAO_ using the snd_intel8x0 module.
16670,10.1,The submitter (Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen) should try passing "ac97_quirk=hp_only" to the snd-via82xx module.
16670,10.2,The person (Fredrik Roos) whose internal speakers are disabled when something is plugged into the headphone socket could try the same with snd-intel8x0 and if this doesn't work then he could try the suggestion at: https://bugtrack.alsa-project.org/alsa-bug/view.php?id=1178 This involves patching the driver and setting a new quirk value.
16670,10.3,Let us know the results !!!
16670,11.1,How would I most easily pass "ac97_quirk=hp_only" to the snd_via82xx module?
16670,11.2,I have a hard time rmmoding it since all my sound modules are highly interdependant.

16670,13.6,If I need to I'll update one of the following days when I find the time.
16670,14.1,I guess your version of the driver does not support that "quirk".
16670,14.2,You may have better luck with the Breezy version of the driver.
16670,14.3,This means installing a newer kernel package.
16670,14.4,If you don't want to upgrade your kernel package then you can upgrade just the ALSA modules.
16670,14.5,This involves installing alsa-sound from Breezy and generating an alsa-modules package from it (using make-kpkg) for your kernel.
16670,15.1,Please let us know the results of your experiments with the latest ALSA drivers.
16670,16.1,No response.
16670,16.2,Presume fixed.
16843,1.1,Two Canonical developed applications are pre-fixed with "Ubuntu" name.
16843,1.2,They are "Ubuntu Update Manager" and "Ubuntu Device Database".
16843,1.3,The pre-fixing of the Ubuntu name is out of place and clashes with the rest of the desktop.
16843,1.4,It also has the unfortunate side-effect of pushing the applications to the bottom of their respective menus_DOUHAO_ which I'm guessing is probably poor for usability (I haven't launched a study on this or anything).
16843,1.5,In addition_DOUHAO_ the applications feature the Ubuntu logo heavily_DOUHAO_ as well as in their icons.
16843,1.6,This is unnecessary_DOUHAO_ and also out of place with the rest of the desktop (for example_DOUHAO_ wouldn't it be lame and ugly if GNOME plastered their logo and name over all the preference apps/system tools they developed?).
16843,1.7,Ubuntu branding is already prominent on the GDM login_DOUHAO_ the desktop background and (presumably) with the next release the system splash screen - if you haven't figured out whose distribution you're using by the time you make your way down to "System Tools"_DOUHAO_ you probably never will.
16843,1.8,Sure_DOUHAO_ it's not a huge issue that's going to confound anyone for days or lead to them throwing their Ubuntu CDs in the bin while shouting "Linux sucks!"_DOUHAO_ but it's a rough edge on a distribution that is mostly free of them.
16843,2.1,Thanks for your bugreport.
16843,2.2,it was not assigned to a package and therefore I overlooked it.
16843,2.3,Cheers_DOUHAO_ Michael
16843,3.1,This applies to the "Ubuntu Language Selector" as well.
16843,3.2,Although it doesn't use the logo_DOUHAO_ it does use the "Ubuntu" prefix in the menu.
16843,3.3,I propose that it be renamed "Language" on the menu.
16843,3.4,After all_DOUHAO_ the other tools are not called "Screensaver Selector" "Desktop Background Selector" "Theme Selector" etc.
16843,4.1,Language selector is debranded and Update-manager is partly debranded (needs a new logo still).
16843,5.1,(In reply to comment #3)
16843,5.2,> Language selector is debranded and Update-manager is partly debranded (needs a > new logo still).
16843,5.3,>
16843,5.4,I don't think the update-manager logo is bad at all_DOUHAO_ because it is used to update your Ubuntu.
16843,5.5,Showing Ubuntu cd's here is quite appropriate I think.
16843,5.6,And while changing names_DOUHAO_ I think synaptic package management could be changed to just package management.
16843,5.7,It is currently the only program in that whole menu that has a name in front of it.
16843,6.1,Oh and we still have Ubuntu device database which should be debranded as well
16843,7.1,*** Bug 26027 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug.
16843,7.2,***
16843,8.1,I still would love to get a more general icon for update-manager.
16843,8.2,My skills at desiging icons suck unfortunately.

16843,9.7,Frankly I disagree.
16843,9.8,In fact one of my pet peeves of most linux desktops is they "hide" the names of the installed software packages with generic names.
16843,9.9,It gets even more confusing if you install similar applications.
16843,9.10,Rhythmbox should be called "Rhythmbox"_DOUHAO_ period (or Rhythmbox Audio Player_DOUHAO_ but at least keep the applications name).
16843,10.1,Can this be closed now that update-manager has been taken care of and that hwdb-gui doesn't show up in the menus as default ?
16843,10.2,Rebranding the program to not mention 'Ubuntu' is probably not ideal_DOUHAO_ because it is specific to Ubuntu (and could help avoid confusing as to where the data goes).
177438,1.1,Binary package hint: update-manager
177438,1.2,When you have run update-manager proper_DOUHAO_ and decided to not install an update_DOUHAO_ the notification icon remains orange.
177438,1.3,It would be useful to have a distinct indication for "seen but ignored" updates_DOUHAO_ so that an orange icon would always mean "new updates you should consider".
177438,2.1,Here's a mock-up of the three suggested states.
177438,2.2,The first is "new updates available"_DOUHAO_ the second is "update-manager (or other aptish tool) running"_DOUHAO_ and the third is the new "old updates available".
177438,2.3,Pardon me if the color I chose is revolting; I picked purple to go with the "visited link" color commonly used in web browsers.
177438,3.1,Actually the color is too pinkish; I guess I shouldn't have included gamma correction -- it looked fine over here.
177438,3.2,(Usually somehow my local images look bleak when I upload and view them in the web browser if I don't click the "include gamma" PNG option in Gimp).
177438,3.3,Anyhow_DOUHAO_ you can probably do better than me on the design.
177438,3.4,(See also bug #43089 for coordination).
177438,4.1,Could you give some examples of why this would be useful?
177438,4.2,I can see what you're on about - but why?
177438,4.3,It needs to be worthwhile before anyone will want to write the code_DOUHAO_ Also please mention which version of Ubuntu you're running.

177438,5.5,Why one might want to skip an update_DOUHAO_ or why one would like to see whether the available updates are genuinely new?
177438,5.6,If an update requires a reboot or otherwise seems dangerous_DOUHAO_ I will generally put off installing it.
177438,5.7,When I have done this_DOUHAO_ I am likely to miss potentially critical new updates because the "updates availabe" icon is there all the time_DOUHAO_ and it doesn't tell me whether the available updates are "new" or the ones I skipped already.
177438,5.8,If this is sufficient for removing the "incomplete" tag_DOUHAO_ please do.
177438,5.9,Otherwise_DOUHAO_ do you think you could provide more instructions for what sort of information would be useful?

177438,5.14,Well_DOUHAO_ maybe not.

177438,7.1,What about if security updates had their own visual style.
177438,7.2,Presumable people want to install all security updates - then other updates you've skipped won't be relevant - whenever a security update is waiting_DOUHAO_ Would that fix the issue?

177438,8.4,I don't think so.
177438,8.5,In fact_DOUHAO_ oftentimes_DOUHAO_ the updates I want to postpone are security updates_DOUHAO_ because they are the ones which require a reboot.
177438,8.6,As such_DOUHAO_ not a bad idea to have a different color coding for high-priority updates.
177438,8.7,But what I want is a way to distinguish new updates from skipped_DOUHAO_ precisely because there might be updates I do want while I am postponing a particularly intrusive update.

18006,1.1,When creating DVDs the filesystem is created as ISO_DOUHAO_ just as it should be for a CD.
18006,1.2,Some DVD players will cope with this_DOUHAO_ but many will not.
18006,1.3,It seems like if I am burning a DVD it should use UDF for the filesystem_DOUHAO_ or perhaps it should have an option.
18006,1.4,I'm not sure whether this should be considered a bug or a feature request.
18006,1.5,http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=309204: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=309204
18006,2.1,Also consider that iso9660 has size limits around 2 GB or 4 GB.
18006,2.2,And filename legth limits etc_DOUHAO_ Just use UDF.
18006,3.1,Thanks for the bug report.
18006,3.2,This particular bug has already been reported into our bug tracking system_DOUHAO_ but please feel free to report any further bugs you find.
18006,3.3,This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 17592 .
18006,4.1,This is NOT a duplicate of 11307?
18006,4.2,They are completely different issues with completely different solutions.
18006,5.1,11307 is about adding packet writing support.
18006,5.2,This bug is about writing DVD compliant DVDs with nautilus-cd-burner.
18006,5.3,UDF happens to be the filesystem in question in both bugs_DOUHAO_ but DVD-Video is most definitely not packet-written.
18006,6.1,I've forwarded this issue upstream: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=309204
18006,7.1,there is some discussion on the upstream bug if you want to read them
18006,8.1,upstream comment: " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Disk_Format Since ISO 9660 is fully compatible with UDF capable systems and UDF is not compatible with ISO 9600 only capable systems.
18006,8.2,I don't think that n-c-b should use UDF." I'm closing the bug.
18006,8.3,Feel free to reopen if you want to argue with upstream
18006,9.1,Every system_DOUHAO_ that can handle DVDs_DOUHAO_ can also handle UDF.
18102,1.1,Using Hoary.
18102,1.2,I have done all the HOWTO's on Ubuntu's website and according to my Xorg.0.log_DOUHAO_ the newest ATI drivers are finally installed without and EE's.
18102,1.3,When X loads_DOUHAO_ I get a blank screen and ?lockup_DOUHAO_ not a monitor power down.
18102,1.4,I have tried several different settings in xorg.conf for the display to get it to work but no go.
18102,1.5,This has been a 3 month struggle so far.
18102,1.6,Graphics card is ATI Radeon 9800 Pro 256MB.
18102,1.7,Monitor is Dell 2001FP.
18102,1.8,Resolution is set to 1600x1200.
18102,1.9,Will upload the log and conf.
18102,2.1,Created an attachment (id=2732) "Successful" Xorg.0.log The log of my supposedly successful ATI driver installation.
18102,3.1,Created an attachment (id=2733) My xorg.conf attempting to get monitor to work Is it my monitor settings or is it a failed installation?
18102,4.1,Forgot to add_DOUHAO_ I am using the DVI port by default.
18102,4.2,The same black screen when X starts if I use the regular analog port occurs.
18102,5.1,does it work with the more recent fglrx in breezy?
18102,6.1,Breezy is not released yet until October_DOUHAO_ no ?
18102,7.1,no_DOUHAO_ but if you're brave_DOUHAO_ you can upgrade to the development tree now.
18102,7.2,it may_DOUHAO_ however_DOUHAO_ be a little rocky.
18102,8.1,Hi guys_DOUHAO_ sorry if some of you will receive this message twice: A new version of fglrx has been uploaded to breezy and it is supposed to fix the problem reported in the bug.
18102,8.2,The update will be available shortly in the archive.
18102,8.3,Please test the driver and let me know if it works or not.
18102,8.4,Fabio
18102,9.1,Have just DL the pre-release Hoary and will advise.
18102,9.2,jtw
18102,10.1,Note this does NOT work in Breezy preview release either.
18102,10.2,I did a clean install_DOUHAO_ updated_DOUHAO_ then installed the fglrx packages from Synaptic_DOUHAO_ but still get the black screen when X starts to load.
18102,10.3,As long as I use the Mesa it loads just fine.
18102,11.1,This is STILL not fixed in the release version of Breezy.
18102,11.2,I get the same errors after a clean install and following the now many HOWTO's to install ATI acceleration.
18102,12.1,I realise this bug has been a pretty long and hard road_DOUHAO_ but could you please try to test the current xorg-driver-fglrx and linux-restricted-modules packages in dapper_DOUHAO_ and see if this problem still persists for you?
18102,13.1,FWIW I'm following this bug since I'm using fglrx with a Dell 2001FP over DVI and things are working nicely here.
18102,13.2,BUT Sometimes I do have issues when switching videomodes I get a black screen (like powersaving mode or the resolution is not supported).
18102,13.3,This happens even when I first turn on the computer (before Linux even starts).
18102,13.4,The card is a Radeon 9600: 0000:01:00.1 Display controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV350 AP [Radeon 9600] (Secondary) ATI says this is a problem with a lot of main boards possibly related to having USB2 support enabled or some other things.
18102,13.5,I disabled USB2 support on my mainboard which seems to have decreased the frequency of the problem occuring.
18102,13.6,ASUS is completely unresponsive (although on the forums there is another person saying "me too!").
18102,13.7,In any case_DOUHAO_ I don't think that this is a problem with Ubuntu.
18102,14.1,Will do.
18102,14.2,I have tried and tried with Breezy with the same result_DOUHAO_ but will try again with Dapper.
18102,14.3,jtw
18102,15.1,JTW_DOUHAO_ have you had a chance to test this yet?
18102,16.1,DLing 6.06 now to install and test will advise.

18194,1.1,Read below why this problem is inexcusable.
18194,1.2,There are many complaints_DOUHAO_ including mine that putting files on a cd and using the "Write to." options in nautilus leads to some files being corrupt.
18194,1.3,In System -> Preferences -> Removable Drives and Media Preferences
18194,1.4,my command options are: nautilus --no-desktop burn:
18194,1.5,I was burning a 300.1 MB wav file and later was burning a 16.4MB wav file and word document.
18194,1.6,Often_DOUHAO_ of the few wav files I burn_DOUHAO_ some are corrupt.
18194,1.7,This is such a simple and accessible feature that developers should make sure it works.
18194,1.8,Please release a patch ASAP?
18194,1.9,and contact GNOME developers to make changes accordingly_DOUHAO_ too.
18194,1.10,I enjoy many of the GNOME/Ubuntu features_DOUHAO_ but this is a feature that _should_ work simply without fail everytime_DOUHAO_ always.
18194,2.1,thanks for your bug_DOUHAO_ it's not really useful described as it and bumping the settings will not make it fixed.
18194,2.2,- what version of ubuntu are you using?
18194,2.3,- what version of nautilus-cd-burner are you using?

18194,3.3,
18194,3.4,I'm using Ubuntu 5.04_DOUHAO_ fully updated.
18194,3.5,I have 2.10.0-0ubuntu2 version of nautilus-cd-burner.
18194,3.6,I'm on a i686 Pentium 3 Coppermine (a Dell Optiplex GX200).
18194,3.7,I recorded files onto the disk_DOUHAO_ but note that in the processes of making the cd_DOUHAO_ the progress bar says it is making and ISO first.
18194,3.8,This happens all the time_DOUHAO_ but note that I used gnomebaker (ver.
18194,3.9,0.3-3) successfully to create the same data CD with those files.
18194,3.10,I was using Phillips 52x 700MB 80min CD-R's but I don't think that's the problem because_DOUHAO_ I have used a spindle of 50 and am almost done.
18194,3.11,On Debian via K3B_DOUHAO_ I never had a problem burning onto this brand of disk.
18194,3.12,I'm not quite sure how to use cdrecord_DOUHAO_ but I assume gnomebaker uses it.
18194,3.13,I burned another disk with the debug enable_DOUHAO_ but I can't yet figure out where the debug log is stored.
18194,3.14,This CD also has corrupted files.
18194,3.15,I think that the disk burned too quickly_DOUHAO_ also.
18194,3.16,I had about ~300 MB of data and it finished after a couple seconds/or a minute.

18194,5.4,I don't think that works for me $ gnome-session remove nautilus gnome-session: you're already running a session manager $ nautilus $ nautilus is run_DOUHAO_ but the terminal (GNOME Terminal 2.10.0) moves on afterwards to the next $ line that's one more CD-R lost in the name of science : )

18194,9.3,Do you have the issue with k3b by example?
18194,9.4,Does changing the write speed fix the issue?
18194,10.1,no reply_DOUHAO_ bug closed.
18194,10.2,Feel free to reopen with the asked informations if that's still an issue for you
18194,11.1,I ran out of CD-R's to test.
18194,11.2,k3b had the issue too_DOUHAO_ if I recall correctly.
18194,11.3,Note that I didn't make any modifications to the installed software as it was installed/updated in 5.04.
18194,11.4,Now_DOUHAO_ I do recall having this problem before on another distribution (maybe Debian_DOUHAO_ maybe non-Debian) in Gnome burning tools_DOUHAO_ however I was able to configure k3b in that distribution to work without problems most of the time-- it was quite reliable.
18194,11.5,So_DOUHAO_ this may be a hardware issue_DOUHAO_ too (with relation to cdrecord)?
18194,12.1,Well_DOUHAO_ I had this issue and I understand what happens.
18194,12.2,In fact_DOUHAO_ if you burn as root_DOUHAO_ you will have no problem.
18194,12.3,The normal user has just not enough privilege to set his cdrecord process in high priority for the kernel_DOUHAO_ so the burning process is often interupted and that leads to corrupted files.
18194,12.4,The workaround was simply to burn as root.
18194,12.5,I solved definitly this issue by adding myself to a group_DOUHAO_ but I don't remmeber wich one.
18194,13.1,can you try what Lionel described and note if that fixes your issue?
18194,14.1,(In reply to comment #12)
18194,14.2,> can you try what Lionel described and note if that fixes your issue?
18194,14.3,I just bought more CD-R's_DOUHAO_ I think I have spent more than 5 already.
18194,14.4,I should invest in CD-RW : ) I tried with sudo nautilus and used the "write to disc_DOUHAO_ " function but this did not work either.
18194,14.5,I get a success message but only part of the disc has been written to (you can see darker parts on foil where data has been written to.
18194,14.6,When I run the files_DOUHAO_ they are bogus.
18194,14.7,Another experiment I did before this was to use k3b on default settings (non-root) and the file burned more completely except there were obvious errors this time since the video did not contain sound when played off the disc versus off the harddrive.
18194,14.8,I do remember having to be root user to successfully burn in k3b when I used Debian Testing/Sarge.
18194,14.9,There was a solution that allowed regular users tburn in k3b which may have involved downloading extra packages and changing a few settings.
18194,14.10,I never remember successfully making a disc in GNOME my entire Linux career.
18194,14.11,My successes were all in k3b which became quiet reliable.
18194,14.12,I didn't have debug report printed while burning but I expect it to be the same as the previous one I posted.
18194,14.13,And again_DOUHAO_ this hardware has been able to write many many successful discs (of many different types) with k3b.
18194,15.1,Do you still get this problem with Breezy?
18194,16.1,It seems that this bug is solved in Breezy.
18194,16.2,My mother's computer had the problem in Hoary but just dist-upgrade to breezy solved it.
18194,16.3,She's even able to burn DVD without any problem.
18194,16.4,I mark this bug as fixed.
18194,16.5,Feel free to reopen it if needed.
184060,1.1,The way that the ClientStorage cache processes invalidations can cause loadBefore() to give an answer although the underlying storage would not give the same answer (e.g.
184060,1.2,because it doesn't support revisions).
184060,2.1,Is this a bad thing?
184060,2.2,If so_DOUHAO_ why?
184060,4.1,Well_DOUHAO_ two ZEO clients giving different answers for the same question would be an undesirable inconsistency.
184060,4.2,I think that would be bad.
184060,4.3,As MappingStorage by now (AFAIK) implements MVCC completely and thus supports loadBefore the issue isn't as bad.
184060,4.4,However_DOUHAO_ when trying to create a test case_DOUHAO_ I stumbled over this which causes a similar inconsistency: Traceback (most recent call last): File "bin/py"_DOUHAO_ line 42_DOUHAO_ in ?
184060,4.5,execfile(__file__) File "test_loadBefore.py"_DOUHAO_ line 35_DOUHAO_ in ?
184060,4.6,print c2.loadBefore(oid_DOUHAO_ rev2) File "/home/ctheune/Development/ZODB/trunk/src/ZEO/ClientStorage.py"_DOUHAO_ line 834_DOUHAO_ in loadBefore t = self._server.loadBefore(oid_DOUHAO_ tid) File "/home/ctheune/Development/ZODB/trunk/src/ZEO/ServerStub.py"_DOUHAO_ line 189_DOUHAO_ in loadBefore return self.rpc.call("loadBefore"_DOUHAO_ oid_DOUHAO_ tid) File "/home/ctheune/Development/ZODB/trunk/src/ZEO/zrpc/connection.py"_DOUHAO_ line 703_DOUHAO_ in call raise inst # error raised by server ZODB.POSException.POSKeyError: 0x0321 See the attached script for producing that error.
184060,4.7,It assumes a ZEO server running on port 8100.
184060,4.8,The exception occurs at the point in time where a storage that doesn't support loadBefore would return None.
184060,4.9,So in this case packing causes an inconsistency in the cache of c1 (as it still has the loadBefore data) versus c2 (it doesn't have that entry in the cache and tries to look it up unsuccessfully on the server).

184060,6.4,I don't agree at all.
184060,6.5,FileStorage too can give different answers to that same question_DOUHAO_ depending on how they've been packed.
184060,6.6,A storage should return a record if it has one.
184060,6.7,Whether it has one is a function of it's implementation_DOUHAO_ but it is better to return a value if possible.

184060,6.15,Storages aren't technically allowed not to support loadBefore_DOUHAO_ since it's part of IStorage and isn't optional.
184060,6.16,(I'm surprised it isn't optional).
184060,6.17,A storage is supposed to return None if it doesn't have a record before the given time for the given oid.
184060,6.18,It is suppose to raise POException if it doesn't have any records for thegiven oid.
184060,6.19,BaseStorage gets this wrong_DOUHAO_ although returning None all the time seems pretty harmless.
184060,6.20,Your test gets a POSKeyError because you packed away the oid and the underlying storage is correctly raises POSKeyError.
184060,6.21,If you want to find fault with ClientStorage_DOUHAO_ it would be due to the fact that the cache still has data for the object even though it has been packed away.
184060,6.22,I don't think it matters and I wouldn't want to have to notify clients of object deletions.
184060,6.23,It only matters in pathological cases_DOUHAO_ like the tests_DOUHAO_ in which objects aren't reachable.
184060,6.24,loadBefore is an optimization to avoid conflicts.
184060,6.25,Having client storage provide loadBefore when it can is a good thing.

18716,1.1,Sound was working fine for older SuSE releases and kernel 2.4.x series.
18716,1.2,Now I tried Kubuntu 5.04_DOUHAO_ but up to now it was impossible to get sound.
18716,1.3,Yes_DOUHAO_ I have read the forum and followed the hints.
18716,1.4,root@tp770:~ # modprobe snd-cs4236 FATAL: Error inserting snd_cs4236 (/lib/modules/2.6.10-5-386/kernel/sound/isa/cs423x/snd-cs4236.ko): No such device FATAL: Error running install command for snd_cs4236
18716,1.5,Of course the module is there_DOUHAO_ but there is no sound device created during installation and boot.
18716,1.6,/dev/sn* is completely empty.
18716,1.7,I assume that this is the root cause_DOUHAO_ but I have no clue how to solve this.
18716,2.1,Use the DOS PS2.EXE command to enable the sound device.
18716,3.1,Did this already_DOUHAO_ but the result is still unpredictable.
18716,3.2,After a start or reboot no sound driver is loaded (although the setup is specified in /etc/modprobe.d/sound: options snd device_mode=0666 alias snd-card-0 snd-cs4236 alias sound-slot-0 snd-cs4236 options snd-cs4236 port=0x530 cport=0x538 isapnp=0 dma1=1 dma2=0 irq=5 when loading the driver manually it works.
18716,3.3,Then you can run /usr/share/alsa-base/snddevices_DOUHAO_ then restart the session for that KDE finds /dev/dsp0_DOUHAO_ this is not really how it should work.
18716,4.1,I forgot: You have to unmute the volume using alsamixer as well_DOUHAO_
18716,5.1,Do you have alsa-base installed and have you selected ALSA in "dpkg-reconfigure linux-sound-base"?
18716,6.1,Almost certainly something wrong locally.
18716,7.1,Sorry for not responding so long_DOUHAO_ was on vacation.
18716,7.2,I did a kunbuntu standard installation_DOUHAO_ alsa and linux sound main is installed (according to aptitude)_DOUHAO_ but a package called 'linux-sound-base' does not exist.
18716,7.3,My workaround so far is that I inserted a little script in the runlevel 3&5 to do a modprobe cs4236 - then everything works fine.
18716,7.4,But I dont think that this is a solution for ubuntu as standard_DOUHAO_
18716,8.1,I am glad that the snd-cs4236 module now loads and works properly.
18716,8.2,Adding the module name to /etc/modules is a simpler way to ensure that the module is loaded at boot time.
18716,9.1,Well_DOUHAO_ for the kernel 2.6 series it should be in /etc/modprobe.d/sound - where it is added_DOUHAO_ but it is although *not* being loaded_DOUHAO_
18716,10.1,(In reply to comment #8)
18716,10.2,> Well_DOUHAO_ for the kernel 2.6 series it should be in /etc/modprobe.d/sound - where it > is added_DOUHAO_ but it is although *not* being loaded_DOUHAO_
18716,10.3,It is true that the "snd-card-0" alias in /etc/modprobe.d/sound can result in the module named by the argument of that alias getting loaded automatically by libasound2 when a libasound2-using application attempts to open sound card #0.
18716,10.4,However_DOUHAO_ this mechanism does not work reliably on systems with udev.
18716,10.5,These days we expect hotplug or discover to load all required driver modules at boot time_DOUHAO_ but because hotplug and discover are imperfect it is sometimes necessary to add module names to /etc/modules.
18777,1.1,This tab offers 2 things_DOUHAO_ both of which can simply have an intelligent default chosen:
18777,1.2,Temporary Files: This should probably depend upon free space in the partition.
18777,1.3,History: There is no good reason to delete history files and thus this option can be removed.
18777,2.1,Thanks for your bugreport I disagree about the history keeping.
18777,2.2,It's not very usefull IMO to keep the history over a extensive period of time.
18777,2.3,It just tells about installing/upgrading/removal of packages.
18777,2.4,I don't think that a lot of people are interessted in e.g.
18777,2.5,1year old history files.
18777,3.1,Is there any reason why need this option[history] to be something the user can change?
18777,4.1,In the latest version of synaptic the user can choose between "keep history" or "delete history files older than XX days" .
18777,4.2,I'm wondering if this report is still an issue ?
18777,4.3,Thanks.
18777,5.1,Closing this report regarding we had no answer from the reporter and in recent version of synaptic the user can change the history.
18777,5.2,Feel free to reopen if this is still an issue.

22281,5.4,Actually_DOUHAO_ libtool1.4 is about to be removed.
22281,5.5,It's been orphaned for a very long time and planned to be removed after sarge's release.
22281,5.6,Nobody has reassigned it yet however.
22281,5.7,I suggest you start making it build with the current libtool.
22281,5.8,I have no idea about freeradius_DOUHAO_ but could look at it if you want.

22281,5.10,I don't think a Replaces is the proper thing to do here.
22281,5.11,I think the best thing to do is add a Conflicts.

22281,10.33,Shorter .sig for a more eco-friendly paperless office.
24250,1.1,I have a machine at work that uses a web proxy.
24250,1.2,I configured the proxy in my GNOME settings and in the apt settings_DOUHAO_ despite that u-m still says:
24250,1.3,"Failed to download changes.
24250,1.4,Please check if there is an active internet connection"
24250,1.5,u-m should use apt's proxy settings.
24250,1.6,(This is from Hoary_DOUHAO_ cannot check Breezy until I've got in installation CD for it)
24250,2.1,Thanks for your bugreport.
24250,2.2,A possible fix would be to run update-manageras normal user and only become root to actually install the updates.
24250,2.3,This would solve this problem.
24250,2.4,Cheers_DOUHAO_ michael
24250,3.1,But it shows up in the status bar as updates available which I then click on and it says that it can't even get the info about updates because it has no proxy setup.
24250,3.2,Perhaps the wrapper could check my proxy settings before it lauches and set them in the app on the command line?
24250,3.3,john
24250,4.1,I'd still prefer if it took the apt-settings because the apt-settings are the ones used for getting packages.
24250,5.1,What about the state of this bug in Dapper ?
24250,5.2,in Edgy ?
24250,5.3,:) Have a nice day.
24250,6.1,I can't tell as I don't need the proxy settings anymore.
24250,7.1,Old bug with no remaining testers.
24250,7.2,Sorry_DOUHAO_ Feel free to re-open.
24250,8.1,This bug/feature request doesn't depend on Sven.
24250,9.1,I also think that the target audience is anyone in the world and not only people who already use Ubuntu and know how to use Launchpad.
24250,10.1,This looks similar to Bug #19372
24250,11.1,> This looks similar to Bug #19372
24250,11.2,Actually not.
24250,11.3,Bug #19372 is about offline support while this bug is about using the right proxy settings.
24250,12.1,The problem still persists in Feisty.
24250,12.2,I have set Acquire::http::Proxy in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99proxy and I have configured proxy settings in both gnome preferences and synaptic preferences.
24250,12.3,The update manager still doesn't work.
24250,13.1,I still don't think that the gnome proxy settings should be what update-manager should look at for several reasons: 1.
24250,13.2,I might run update-manager with root permissions (remember: I might even do this without a proper intention_DOUHAO_ because all the update tools need superuser priviliges) - then there's no way to access the gnome proxy settings of the user anymore 2.
24250,13.3,The technical reason: update-manager serves (in a rough view) as a front-end to apt.
24250,13.4,Listening to the gnome proxy settings is nice_DOUHAO_ but as long as the apt-settings are not correct (or - by mistake or intention - apt and gnome have different proxy settings)_DOUHAO_ update-manager should still use exactly the same mechanism as apt does.
24250,13.5,Use case: set up a local apt proxy for Ubuntu and use an http proxy to forward all apt-requests to is_DOUHAO_ but the default web access is provided by the plain router setup.
24250,14.1,I think I know what is going on here.
24250,14.2,When you set the proxy settings in your Gnome Preferences_DOUHAO_ it does two different things: - Sets the /system/http_proxy gconf keys - Sets the $http_proxy environment variable.
24250,14.3,It appears to be the second of these that is causing the problem (at least for me).
24250,14.4,If you do an "unset http_proxy" from the command line_DOUHAO_ and then do a "sudo update-manager" things work fine.
24250,14.5,There doesn't appear to be anything wrong with the content of the $http_proxy variable (i.e.
24250,14.6,http://<user>:<pass>@<proxy-server>:<port>/ )_DOUHAO_ so I can only assume that update manager isn't parsing it correctly.
24250,15.1,Unsetting http_proxy solved the problem in gutsy also.
24250,15.2,This problem persits since edgy.
24250,15.3,Why is it not solved yet?
24250,16.1,I have had a similar problem during a Feisty to Gutsy upgrade using apt-cacher as proxy (see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/update-manager/+bug/113658 )_DOUHAO_ but it's a generic proxy problem.
24250,16.2,If Canonical are serious about the corporate market_DOUHAO_ where proxy servers are very common_DOUHAO_ they need to fix this sort of bug_DOUHAO_ Having to hack around on the command line is fine for me since I've used Linux for ages_DOUHAO_ but users new to Linux will probably just give up or have to use the apt-get upgrade method_DOUHAO_ which of course can lead to breakage that requires *more* expertise to fix.
24250,16.3,Please fix this bug and the 113658 bug.
24250,16.4,Your corporate users will thank you!
24250,17.1,I agree with Richard: bug #113658 is related to this.
24250,17.2,Also people here at my university lab (where we use apt-cacher to save bandwith) would benefit a lot?
24250,17.3,(p.s.
24250,17.4,Richard: put # before the bug number_DOUHAO_ in order to have automatic linking ;) )
24250,18.1,Please set the importance of this bug much higher than it currently is.
24250,18.2,This bug is preventing me from upgrading from Gutsy to Hardy_DOUHAO_ because for bandwidth reasons I have to use apt-cacher.
24250,18.3,Note_DOUHAO_ though_DOUHAO_ that update-manager should follow APT's proxy settings_DOUHAO_ not GNOME's settings.
24250,19.1,This still exists in Hardy.
24250,19.2,Proxy is set in both Gnome and APT.
24250,19.3,FFx works perfectly_DOUHAO_ command line apt or Synaptic Package Manager and Update-Manager fail to connect to the proxy.
24250,19.4,W: Failed to fetch http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/n/nautilus-sendto/nautilus-sendto_0.13.2-0ubuntu3_i386.deb Could not resolve '!1@hrmc'
24250,20.1,I checked the way the proxy initialization works and I changed it so that it now goes in the order of: - apt proxy setting - synaptic proxy setting - gconf proxy setting - http environemnt (in bzr for jaunty).
24250,20.2,If there are still issues left_DOUHAO_ please file them as seperate bugs because the original report (gnome settings not honored) should be fixed with that.
24250,21.1,This bug was fixed in the package update-manager - 1:0.97 --------------- update-manager (1:0.97) jaunty; urgency=low * UpdateManager/Core/MetaRelease.py: - remove debug message (LP: #310046 ) * UpdateManager/Common/utils.py: - when initializing the proxy configuration_DOUHAO_ do in this order: * check apt setting * check synaptic setting * check users gconf * check http_proxy environment (LP: #24250 ) * UpdateManager/Core/DistUpgradeFetcherCore.py: - ensure correct error message if downloading failed (LP: #113658 ) - when fetching from mirrors_DOUHAO_ add fallback if the mirror is too loaded to cope - improve logic that detects what mirror is in use by sources.list inspection (LP: #107983 ) * DistUpgrade/DistUpgradeMain.py_DOUHAO_ dist-upgrade.py: - re-factor and make code more modular - do not overwrite existing log files on upgrade (LP: #111819 ) * reorganize the imports and get rid of "Common" submodule and merge that all into "Core" * improve the debug output via the "DEBUG_UPDATE_MANAGER" environment -- Michael Vogt <email address hidden> Mon_DOUHAO_ 26 Jan 2009 17:26:40 +0100
24250,22.1,Clarification question: Given that this is fixed in Jaunty (much thanks_DOUHAO_ by the way)_DOUHAO_ will it first apply to Intrepid => Jaunty upgrades_DOUHAO_ or Jaunty => Jaunty+1 upgrades?
24250,23.1,I still got this problem in Jaunty.
24250,23.2,Any help appreciated.
24250,24.1,I just downloaded and installed Jaunty_DOUHAO_ the problem is still present.
24250,24.2,Apparently it is possible to set the proxy_DOUHAO_ but never to change it back.
24250,24.3,"Apply system wide" in the network proxy menu seems to not change a thing for the update manager.
24250,24.4,Very annoying!
24250,25.1,Actually there seem to be more issues.
24250,25.2,If the proxy is set once_DOUHAO_ it will never be set back for the update manager_DOUHAO_ apt_DOUHAO_ synaptic_DOUHAO_ but ALSO for totem_DOUHAO_ rythmbox_DOUHAO_ etc.
24250,25.3,Firefox does change itself along with the proxy setting.
24250,25.4,It's like there is still a hidden setting active.
24250,26.1,ok_DOUHAO_ as Matt Mossholder wrote in 2007?
24250,26.2,(#13) the problem is that the network proxy manager from gnome can set_DOUHAO_ but cannot unset the http_proxy environmental variable.
24250,26.3,Only manual unset overrides it_DOUHAO_ and firefox seems to not care?
24250,26.4,Interestingly_DOUHAO_ if you use "reset" in the gnome network proxy manager_DOUHAO_ it will always return to the state with proxy_DOUHAO_ not sure why it assumes that to be the default.
24250,26.5,Please fix this by now?
24250,26.6,Essential bug that has been around way too long.
24250,27.1,The problem is that Synaptic caches the proxy settings in its config file_DOUHAO_ and the "Apply system wide" option doesn't know how to replace that (naturally).
24250,27.2,Take a look in /root/.synaptic/synaptic.conf - I wager you will see the old proxy settings.
24250,27.3,Either correct them there_DOUHAO_ or delete them so that the global settings are used.
24250,27.4,I'd suggest this is a bug in synaptic - it shouldn't cache proxy settings that are obtained from the systemwide config.
24250,28.1,I am trying to do a release upgrade to karmic from jaunty and have noticed it does not honor proxy settings.
24250,28.2,Currently_DOUHAO_ regular upgrades work_DOUHAO_ but the dist-upgrade is failing.
24250,28.3,I am running from a non-privileged user prompt sudo update-manager -d In another terminal i have a tcpdump running.
24250,28.4,When update-manager launches I can see it connecting to my apt-cacher on port 3142.
24250,28.5,But when I click the new distribution upgrade button_DOUHAO_ I can see it making direct requests to the internet_DOUHAO_ bypassing the proxy server.
24250,28.6,I have proxy unset in the environment variables_DOUHAO_ but set in apt.conf_DOUHAO_ in synaptics_DOUHAO_ and in gnome all to the same thing.
24250,28.7,(my apt-cacher) Even when I use the http_proxy= environment variable I get the same result.
24250,28.8,It seems update-manager's dist-upgrade process ignores any proxy setting.
24250,28.9,Is anyone else having this problem?
24250,29.1,See info in #440229 workaround: edit /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/UpdateManager/Core/utils.py and add a line " return True" atthe beginning of the downloadable function: ##################################################" def url_downloadable(uri_DOUHAO_ debug_func=None): """ helper that checks if the given uri exists and is downloadable (supports optional debug_func function handler to support e.g.
24250,29.2,logging) Supports http (via HEAD) and ftp (via size request) """ return True if debug_func: debug_func("url_downloadable: %s" % uri) import urlparse _DOUHAO_ ##################################################"
24250,30.1,Distribution upgrade_DOUHAO_ as noted above_DOUHAO_ ignores proxy settings from any source I've tried (apt_DOUHAO_ env_DOUHAO_ gnome).
24250,30.2,This means normal package upgrades work fine_DOUHAO_ but you are unable to use the 'Upgrade' button on Update Manager.
24250,31.1,I have seen this as well.
24250,31.2,It seems only to be a problem when you click on the 'Upgrade' button_DOUHAO_ when it does some checks before displaying the Release Notes.
24250,31.3,I can verify this by starting update-manager with ports 80 and 443 blocked on the proxy server (ie_DOUHAO_ http and https forced through the proxy)_DOUHAO_ clicking 'Upgrade' (at which point update-manager freezes) and then going on to the proxy and unblocking those two ports.
24250,31.4,When the firewall is restarted with ports 80 and 443 open_DOUHAO_ update-manager continues to the Release Notes page.
24250,31.5,I can then block the ports on the proxy again and the upgrade continues as normal_DOUHAO_ using the proxy.
24250,31.6,I am guessing that there is just one point in the code where the proxy is being ignored.
24250,32.1,MetaRelease.py (the Python code that does the check) uses urllib2 directly_DOUHAO_ and doesn't use the apt/synaptic settings.
24250,32.2,Although urllib2 looks at the environment variables for proxy settings_DOUHAO_ sudo zaps these for security reasons.
24250,32.3,I was able to make it work by using sudo -s to get a root shell_DOUHAO_ setting the environment variables_DOUHAO_ and then running update-manager.
24250,32.4,My squid access log shows that it fetched http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/meta-release .
24250,32.5,I believe this is a bug in MetaRelease.py_DOUHAO_ which should be changed to use the proxy settings from apt/synaptic.
24250,33.1,I did the following and now I hav resolved my synaptic system using proxy_DOUHAO_ Take a look in /root/.synaptic/synaptic.conf - I wager you will see the old proxy settings.
24250,33.2,Either correct them there_DOUHAO_ or delete them so that the global settings are used.
24250,33.3,BUT I still can't seem to get updates via synaptic_DOUHAO_ now getting a different error message_DOUHAO_ as follows.
24250,33.4,(PLEASE HELP) W: Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/jaunty/main/i18n/Translation-en_ZA.bz2 Could not resolve 'archive.ubuntu.com'
24250,34.1,That bug is really annoying.
24250,34.2,And it appears to have been there for a long time.
24250,34.3,But not affecting everyone for some strange reason.
24250,34.4,I tried to upgrade from Jaunty to Karmic today and all proxy settings were ignored_DOUHAO_ I had them in apt_DOUHAO_ update-manager and in the enrivonment just fine_DOUHAO_ nothing worked.
24250,34.5,In the end I edited utils.py as suggested by Serge van Ginderachter and this made it finally working?
24250,34.6,The strange thing is_DOUHAO_ when I did the last upgrade from Intrepid to Jaunty the whole update process worked just fine without messing with any settings.
24250,34.7,So probably something changed (again?) with Jaunty?
24250,35.1,How many people noticed that according to this bug's status_DOUHAO_ it has already been fixed.
24250,35.2,If that's incorrect_DOUHAO_ then please change the status accordingly.
24250,35.3,Otherwise_DOUHAO_ please search for / file an appropriate bug report.
24250,35.4,Commenting on an already-fixed bug seems to me to be a waste of time.
24250,36.1,Ok_DOUHAO_ I have changed to incomplete.
24250,37.1,Thanks Serge I tried return True as described in comment 28 https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/update-manager/+bug/24250/comments/28 He is right_DOUHAO_ that this routine url_downloadable() is the cause of the issue.
24250,37.2,By skipping straight over it_DOUHAO_ all is well.
24250,37.3,Until there is a patch_DOUHAO_ I believe this is a solution to getting your boxes upgraded behind a proxy or apt-cacher.
24250,37.4,John
24250,38.1,Ok_DOUHAO_ if u look at #361554 someone has proposed a fix.
24250,38.2,Marking as duplicate
251074,1.1,The buttons in the delete confirmation dialogs are "Yes" and "No".
251074,1.2,They should be "Delete" and "Cancel"_DOUHAO_ as per the GNOME HIG: http://library.gnome.org/devel/hig-book/stable/windows-alert.html.en
251074,2.1,Description of problem: It would be nice if virt-manager also removed or at least offered to remove the diskfile when deleting a vm_DOUHAO_ so that old stale vm diskfiles are not left lying around.
251074,3.1,Created attachment 289121 patch for deleting img files when deleting machine (optional choice)
251074,4.1,This is not very pleasant UI - you get shown 2 separate dialog boxes when deleting_DOUHAO_ and the deleting of disk images is all-or-nothing.
251074,4.2,The latter doesn't work when a VM has 2 disk images_DOUHAO_ one private_DOUHAO_ the other shared across several VMs (eg for CluterSuite quorum partitions); Similarly if the guest has an ISO image attached for virtual CDROM you don't want to delete that.
251074,4.3,This really needs just a single confirmation dialog box for deleting a VM_DOUHAO_ and in that dialog a list of all disk images which checkboxes to select which should be deleted.
251074,4.4,It should list the disk size_DOUHAO_ and whether its readonly/shared.
251074,5.1,Created attachment 289131 sry.
251074,5.2,typo in previous patch :)
251074,6.1,Daniel: hm_DOUHAO_ ok.
251074,6.2,I can try do it when I will have a time.
251074,7.1,Based on the date this bug was created_DOUHAO_ it appears to have been reported during the development of Fedora 8.
251074,7.2,In order to refocus our efforts as a project we are changing the version of this bug to '8'.
251074,7.3,If this bug still exists in rawhide_DOUHAO_ please change the version back to rawhide.
251074,7.4,(If you're unable to change the bug's version_DOUHAO_ add a comment to the bug and someone will change it for you).
251074,7.5,Thanks for your help and we apologize for the interruption.
251074,7.6,The process we're following is outlined here: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugZappers/F9CleanUp We will be following the process here: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugZappers/HouseKeeping to ensure this doesn't happen again.
251074,8.1,(Haven't tried yet on rawhide yet BTW since I can't install guests there yet).
251074,9.1,The disk-files still don't get deleted when deleting a virtual machine.
251074,9.2,There is no question to do so_DOUHAO_ neither is there an option.
251074,11.1,This message is a reminder that Fedora 8 is nearing its end of life.
251074,11.2,Approximately 30 (thirty) days from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 8.
251074,11.3,It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained.
251074,11.4,At that time this bug will be closed as WONTFIX if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '8'.
251074,11.5,Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version_DOUHAO_ simply change the 'version' to a later Fedora version prior to Fedora 8's end of life.
251074,11.6,Bug Reporter: Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we may not be able to fix it before Fedora 8 is end of life.
251074,11.7,If you would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version of Fedora please change the 'version' of this bug to the applicable version.
251074,11.8,If you are unable to change the version_DOUHAO_ please add a comment here and someone will do it for you.
251074,11.9,Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's lifetime_DOUHAO_ sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.
251074,11.10,Often a more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes bugs or makes them obsolete.
251074,11.11,The process we are following is described here: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugZappers/HouseKeeping
251074,12.1,As mentioned above_DOUHAO_ we need some intelligent UI to get this right.
251074,12.2,We _still_ don't have this upstream though_DOUHAO_ but it is at the top of my list.
251074,12.3,Moving to F10 since it is still applicable there.
251074,13.1,A simple start would just be to popup a dialog asking if you want to delete the disk image too locally.
251074,14.1,(In reply to comment #10)
251074,14.2,> A simple start would just be to popup a dialog asking if you want to delete the > disk image too locally.
251074,14.3,Jens_DOUHAO_ I don't think that it is good idea to have this simple version of dialog.
251074,14.4,You could have many "disk images" in your virtual machine and not everytime you want to delete all images.
251074,14.5,So you have to have list with checkboxes (or something similar).
251074,19.1,The wording has been fixed upstream (by committing a patch from me)_DOUHAO_ but the button fixing is pending another change.
251074,22.1,Upstream now has a robust 'Delete VM' dialog which allows removing storage_DOUHAO_ providing enough info for the user to make a reasonable decision about what to remove.
251074,22.2,Moving to POST.
251074,22.3,http://hg.et.redhat.com/cgi-bin/hg-virt.cgi/applications/virt-manager--devel/rev/f8ad3d826039 The pending new virt-manager version will probably end up in F10_DOUHAO_ but likely not for a good while (maybe F11 release time frame).
251074,24.1,I think it's too late to be backporting a major virt-manager version to F10_DOUHAO_ so moving this bug F11 (where it is fixed) and closing as CURRENTRELEASE.
251074,26.1,This is fixed in recent virt-manager versions_DOUHAO_ such as the one currently in Lucid.
251074,26.2,Closing this bug.
28447,1.1,
28447,1.,
28447,1.2,the test for verbosity is backwards on line 60
28447,1.3,
28447,2.,
28447,1.4,the 'for' in line 70 splits the mount output into separate words_DOUHAO_ rather than lines.
28447,1.5,this results in each line of output from mount being split over several log warning messages
28447,1.6,The attached patch fixes both of these issues.
28447,2.1,Created an attachment (id=5654) this patch fixes both problems
28447,3.1,the patch makes it less verbose_DOUHAO_ but only prints the first mount line_DOUHAO_ not all.
28447,3.2,was this intended?
28447,4.1,The script as it stood before only output the first mount line if VERBOSE was set to something other than "no"_DOUHAO_ such as "yes".
28447,4.2,It looks very much as if the author's intention was to have the script be less verbose if VERBOSE was set to "no"_DOUHAO_ not more verbose_DOUHAO_ so I switched the sense of the check for $VERBOSE.
28447,4.3,It seems crazy to have "VERBOSE=no" being the most verbose option.
28447,4.4,If the intention is to always output all the mount lines then the test for $VERBOSE should be removed altogether.
28447,4.5,VERBOSE is set in /etc/default/rcS by the way.
28447,5.1,This patch splits the output in lines by some hackish interpretation of the mount output.
28447,5.2,It works fine AFAICS_DOUHAO_ with one exception: if an error is followed by a mount message they're both shown on one line.
28447,6.1,The recent update (initscripts version 2.86.ds1-6ubuntu9) fixes the first part of this bug_DOUHAO_ but does nothing about the 2nd part.
28447,6.2,This code is used: for MOUNT_MESSAGE_TO_PRINT in $(echo "$MOUNT_MESSAGES" | egrep -v '(already|nothing was) mounted') ; do log_warning_msg $MOUNT_MESSAGE_TO_PRINT done The "for" will pick each *word* from the output of egrep in turn_DOUHAO_ and print is as a warning message_DOUHAO_ whereas we want it to pick each line in turn.
28447,6.3,Hence the "| while read" in my patch.
28447,7.1,From what I see_DOUHAO_ the first issue is not fixed in initscripts 2.86.ds1-6ubuntu9: if [ "$VERBOSE" != no ]; then # Print only the first line output which I interpret as: if verbose then print only first line.
28447,8.1,> which I interpret as: if verbose then print only first line.
28447,8.2,Right.
28447,8.3,ie.
28447,8.4,"if verbose then print less than if not verbose" ver·bose adj.
28447,8.5,Using or containing a great and usually an excessive number of words; wordy.
28447,8.6,Setting verbose should create MORE output_DOUHAO_ not LESS.
28447,9.1,I'm sorry Tormod.
28447,9.2,I'm agreeing with you_DOUHAO_ Yestersay I tried to post this: >> The recent update (initscripts version 2.86.ds1-6ubuntu9) fixes the >> first part of this bug_DOUHAO_ but does nothing about the 2nd part.
28447,9.3,> > My mistake.
28447,9.4,The recent update doesn't touch either of the 2 bugs_DOUHAO_ and > is completely unrelated.
28447,9.5,> > Sorry.
28447,9.6,but it appears that Gmail didn't honour the 'Reply-To:' header in the email I was replying to_DOUHAO_ and it ended up sending the comment to me_DOUHAO_ not to Malone.
28447,10.1,In case some developer would be interested_DOUHAO_ this log shows what it looks like at boot-up.
28447,10.2,I can confirm that Chris' small patch (the first) resolves the issue.
28447,11.1,The bug has a nice patch since 2 months.
28447,11.2,Is there anything we can do to help this getting committed?
28447,12.1,I don't think so.
28447,12.2,I ended up having to give up on ubuntu.
28447,12.3,Too many bugs like this go unfixed.
28447,13.1,Chris_DOUHAO_ I just now saw your CC to me on this Bug Report_DOUHAO_ as this bug also bugs me since a couple of months_DOUHAO_ but was busy to track down and understand_DOUHAO_ I'll test your patch and see if it fixes the issue.
28447,13.2,If so I'll try to get the wheel going again to include it.
28447,14.1,With the danger of going off-topic: Chris_DOUHAO_ don't give up.
28447,14.2,Ubuntu is much more responsive to bug reports and get more fixed faster than_DOUHAO_ say_DOUHAO_ debian.
28447,14.3,However_DOUHAO_ I really wonder_DOUHAO_ what can be improved in the launchpad/packaging/maintainer system to make these things go smoother.
28447,14.4,I mean_DOUHAO_ a clean_DOUHAO_ non-risk_DOUHAO_ corrective patch lying untouched for two months_DOUHAO_ with all kind of freezes now approaching in a "enterprise-ready" release ?
28447,14.5,(okay_DOUHAO_ I should take this to the forum instead_DOUHAO_ sorry)
28447,15.1,sysvinit (2.86.ds1-6ubuntu21) dapper; urgency=low .
28447,15.2,* debian/patches/100_mountall_fix_output.dpatch: - Fix the check for verbosity.
28447,15.3,- Fix the output when mounting filesystems to display complete lines rather then broken into each word.
28447,15.4,- Thanks to Chris Moore <email address hidden> - Malone #28447 Thanks to Sivan!
28447,16.1,Congratulations to all making this fixed?
28447,16.2,However_DOUHAO_ there is still something that seems backwards: Before there was nothing displayed in usplash (which I think is preferred behaviour) but all the verbose output displayed in console 8 (and in usplash_log as STATUS lines).
28447,16.3,Now_DOUHAO_ this first line (which seems pretty random_DOUHAO_ in my case this is a totally unimportant partition) is displayed in usplash_DOUHAO_ which seems a little ugly.
28447,16.4,(It also appears on console 8 and in usplash_log as a TEXT line).
28447,16.5,If I understand correctly_DOUHAO_ TEXT appears in usplash_DOUHAO_ and is created by the log_action_cont_msg function.
28447,16.6,The STATUS messages are created by the log_warning_msg function.
28447,16.7,I therefore suggest changing the non-verbose behaviour to also use log_warning_msg.
28447,17.1,Actually_DOUHAO_ no reason it should be a log_warning_msg.
28447,17.2,It should rather be a log_success_msg_DOUHAO_ if anything at all.
28447,17.3,What is the interest of that one first line anyway?
28447,17.4,Well_DOUHAO_ this patch cleans up the usplash screen at least.
28447,18.1,Sounds interesting because my bootprocess gets interrupted by verbose mount output too.
28447,18.2,But how to apply this patch?
28447,19.1,dorpm_DOUHAO_ the patch is not valid any longer.
28447,19.2,The scripts were later changed_DOUHAO_ and now look different in both 6.06 final and in edgy.
28447,19.3,Can you please attach your /dev/.initramfs/usplash_log ?
28447,20.1,Here you are
28447,21.1,Florian_DOUHAO_ since your usplash_log stops at "Checking root file system"_DOUHAO_ I think it is the checking of the root fs that takes so much time that usplash quits_DOUHAO_ and you get all these messages afterwards.
28447,22.1,Is there a time-dependency?
28447,22.2,Unfortunately the log was from a boot process where the root fs was completely checked.
28447,22.3,But normally there is not much more in the log: TEXT Checking root file system_DOUHAO_ SUCCESS ok PROGRESS 27 PROGRESS 29 PROGRESS 31 TEXT Checking all filesystems_DOUHAO_ At the latest usplash stops here.
28447,22.4,Is there any chance to change this behaviour?
28447,22.5,Florian
28447,23.1,usplash has a timeout_DOUHAO_ so that if something takes longer than normally expected_DOUHAO_ the splash screen goes away so that the user can read the messages and see what is going on.
28447,23.2,Probably you have some filesystems that are slow to check.
28447,23.3,I experienced this myself when I had two vfat filesystems in /etc/fstab.
28447,24.1,Here I found something that sounds interesting: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-75132.html It seems that the timeout can be changed in /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/usplash by adding /sbin/usplash_write "TIMEOUT 60" at the end of the file.
28447,24.2,What do you think?
28447,24.3,Florian
28447,25.1,Florian_DOUHAO_ if you do: grep '"TIMEOUT' /etc/init.d/* you'll see that several start-up scripts change the timeout.
28447,25.2,You can try modifying checkfs.sh if you like.
28447,25.3,See bug #22658 for more on this.
28447,26.1,Thanks Tormod_DOUHAO_ that worked for me?
28447,26.2,Florian
30090,1.1,Suggestion:
30090,1.2,The start screen of Adept is too cluttered for beginners:
30090,1.3,http://www.felixrommel.de/fileadmin/bugs/ubuntu/dapper/dapper-beta-adept-default-screen.png
30090,1.4,The filters should be folded by default and the tags view on the right side beside the packages list should also be folded by default.
30090,1.5,A basic user wants to search for a package and is not interested in Filters or advanced options.
30090,1.6,He does not know that "Quick Filter" means searching a package.
30090,1.7,It should be renamed to sth.
30090,1.8,like "Search package:"
30090,1.9,If Kubuntu shall be beginner friendly a easy to use package manager is a must!
30090,2.1,Suggestions for improvements: - Add a "View" menu where you can enable the filters.
30090,2.2,The tags section on the right side could be very small like on screenshot or also be able to enable it through the "View" menu.
30090,2.3,- Replace commit changes with sth like "Install packages" - Replace "Quickfilter" with "Search Package:" Have a look for a mockup: http://www.felixrommel.de/fileadmin/bugs/ubuntu/dapper/dapper-beta-adept-default-screen-Improved.png This is all a user should see on startup.
30090,3.1,I think the view menu should definitely be added_DOUHAO_ but I'm leaning toward keeping the INSTALLED_DOUHAO_ NOT-INSTALLED_DOUHAO_ UPGRADABLE check boxes visible by default.
30090,3.2,I don't think "commit changes" should be changed to "install packages" because that's misleading and that's not always what you're doing.
30090,3.3,Changing quickfilter to search definitely makes it more intuitive.
30090,4.1,There were usability-related changes in adept recently.
30090,4.2,Also_DOUHAO_ adept manager is NOT meant to be a friendly and easy on beginners.
30090,4.3,See adept installer for that.
30090,4.4,Not changing the adept manager target group => rejecting.
31512,1.1,Currently the acpid log output is far too verbose.
31512,1.2,Ideally it would be small enough that we could log it using syslog to daemon.log but since it currently produces ca.
31512,1.3,17 lines of log for each battery event in my laptop_DOUHAO_ said events occurring semi-regularly and producing around 60 to 90 thousand lines of log per day_DOUHAO_ it would be too much to syslog right now.
31512,1.4,There are various ways to make it simpler (E.g.
31512,1.5,not sending the handler-output log lines if there's no handler output) and we should look into these
31512,2.1,This is causing bug 59695 (the infamous laptop-killing bug)_DOUHAO_ or rather_DOUHAO_ is the actual cause of the drive problem.
31512,2.2,On my laptop_DOUHAO_ ACPID gets a battery event roughly every 15 seconds_DOUHAO_ each of these produces a write to the log file.
31512,2.3,Laptop hard drives seem to be set up for bursty I/O (a reasonably assumption for general laptop usage)_DOUHAO_ so their worst-case scenario is precisely this_DOUHAO_ a single write every 15 seconds.
31512,2.4,The laptop parks after 10 seconds of inactivity_DOUHAO_ then gets woken up about 5 seconds later_DOUHAO_ and this repeats continuously whenever the laptop is idle.
31512,2.5,The simplest fix is to disable ACPID logging by adding "-l /dev/null" to the command line.
31512,2.6,Ultimately ACPID should be changed to only log errors and infrequent events.
31512,2.7,This needs to be communicated upstream - it will happen on any distro that uses ACPID and lets it log its output.
31512,2.8,I've seen it on Debian_DOUHAO_ too.
31512,3.1,I cannot confirm this on an Asus G1S-A1 laptop (Gutsy_DOUHAO_ x86-64).
31512,3.2,/var/log/acpid accumulates less than 3k per week on this model_DOUHAO_ despite intensive use.
31512,3.3,However_DOUHAO_ I do see bug 59695 regardless.
31512,3.4,I think that we have to be careful with pinpointing a single source for the hard drive problems.
31512,3.5,If it is indeed caused by filesystem and daemon activity_DOUHAO_ it is far more likely that there is a confluence of causes.
31512,4.1,Are you seeing battery events at all in that log?
31512,4.2,Seems strange that they wouldn't appear.
31512,4.3,You are right that it could be any process that's causing the writes_DOUHAO_ though specifically it has to be something that writes regularly with intervals greater than the hard disk park time.
31512,4.4,If several processes are writing to the disk then they are likely to interleave and keep the drive unparked constantly.
31512,4.5,On my Toshiba Libretto L5 and two ThinkPads I have access to it's been ACPID_DOUHAO_ and the existence of this bug led me to believe it's ACPID for others too.
31512,5.1,Yes_DOUHAO_ I see these in the log_DOUHAO_ but only if I plug/unplug the AC adapter.
31512,5.2,There are no regularly scheduled battery events in the log_DOUHAO_ no matter whether I run the laptop on mains or battery.
31512,6.1,I can confirm the excessive logging on a Samsung X20 running Feisty.
31512,6.2,On battery power a battery event gets logged to /var/log/acpid every 30-40s.
31512,6.3,Disabling the logging with -l /dev/null in /etc/default/acpid gets rid of that.
31512,6.4,Please note that for every battery event also /etc/acpi/power.sh is executed_DOUHAO_ so this might wake up your drive even if you disabled logging.
31512,7.1,This is not what is causing #59695 (recently duped to #17216) for me.
31512,7.2,I have no problem with excessive log writes from acpid_DOUHAO_ although there may be some other log that is causing the problem.
31512,7.3,I verified this tailing acpid while running lm-profiler.
31512,7.4,-b
31512,8.1,What did lm-profiler claim was touching the hard disk?
31512,8.2,That's probably the easiest way to work out what's causing the disk to unpark in each case_DOUHAO_ as it seems that various programs can cause the effect of bug 59695 .
31512,8.3,There should probably be some kind of review of installed services to see what does this sort of thing.
31512,8.4,Ideally when my laptop is idle_DOUHAO_ nothing should touch the disk.
31512,8.5,Interestingly it's not just Linux.
31512,8.6,There is a program on my Windows laptop that does the same thing (logs some security rubbish every 20-30 seconds or so)_DOUHAO_ and according to smartmontools its Load_Unload_Cycle is 683863_DOUHAO_ so there go the theories about Windows having some kind of workaround built in.
31512,8.7,My employer requires the app to be installed_DOUHAO_ but then they will pay for the new HD when it fails.
31512,9.1,Partial correction -- It has started logging more often_DOUHAO_ after unplugging and plugging in the battery_DOUHAO_ but seems to log mostly around once every 1-2 minutes.
31512,9.2,However_DOUHAO_ that doesn't fully account for the writes I get from reiserfs/0 (or 1) every 30 seconds (I.e._DOUHAO_ I'm still saying that acpid is not the definitive culprit of the above bugs_DOUHAO_ although it may be a contributor).
31512,10.1,Further correction -- lm-profiler is not reliable for this_DOUHAO_ as it causes log writes itself.
31512,10.2,:-/ It does seem that acpid may be the main culprit.
31512,11.1,Maybe btrace will show you whether acpid logging is indeed too verbose.
31512,11.2,sudo aptitude install blktrace sudo btrace /dev/sda When I ran btrace myself I got this : "/sys/kernel/debug does not appear to be a debug filesystem" That's probably because I have encrypted my disk during the installation (using the alternate cd) I got this information here : https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/17878/comments/31
31512,12.1,regarding my previous post about btrace : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/acpid/+bug/31512/comments/10 You need to first do this : sudo mount -t debugfs none_debug /sys/kernel/debug

31512,14.1,Toshiba Satellite Pro 4600 notebook produces the following_DOUHAO_ when running on AC power (and the battery is 100% charged_DOUHAO_ and has been full for hours)
31512,14.2,Redirecting logging to /dev/null_DOUHAO_ suggested above as a workaround_DOUHAO_ possibly coupled with hdparm -B 254 as suggested elsewhere_DOUHAO_ has reduced the rate of increase of that figure.
31512,14.3,I certainly consider that the "advanced configuration and power interface" daemon_DOUHAO_ of all things_DOUHAO_ writing to a log file several times each minute_DOUHAO_ thus preventing power saving operations from taking place_DOUHAO_ when nothing of any interest is happening_DOUHAO_ is a bug!
31512,15.1,William_DOUHAO_ It should work without the hdparm -B 254 workaround.
31512,15.2,If it doesn't then you have some other program running that is also accessing the disk (suggestions have been thunderbird amongst other things).
31512,15.3,This is one of those annoying bugs where you have to squash all of them before the problem is fixed.
31512,15.4,I have managed to do that on my laptop using the acpid workaround - I left it on_DOUHAO_ idle_DOUHAO_ overnight_DOUHAO_ and the load cycle count increased by 1 when the nightly cronjobs kicked in_DOUHAO_ and then 1 again when I checked the laptop in the morning.
31512,15.5,Disabling power-saving operations on the drive is an unsatisfactory workaround imo_DOUHAO_ as it will reduce battery life_DOUHAO_ increase general power consumption_DOUHAO_ and expose the disk to a greater risk of shock damage as the heads are not parked.

31512,15.7,You are right about there being a cruel irony that_DOUHAO_ for me at least_DOUHAO_ acpid with the primary culprit.
31512,16.1,This bug is quite old (and the comments shifted to offtopic).
31512,16.2,acpid 1.0.6 uses syslog logging now (Hardy has 1.0.4) and there's a similar bug report in Debian_DOUHAO_ which I'll link.
31512,18.1,What does that mean_DOUHAO_ "add -l /dev/null" to the command line"?
31512,18.2,What is the full command to disable acpid logging?
31512,18.3,I'm getting an event in the log every second_DOUHAO_ but I can't figure out how to disable it.
31512,18.4,sudo acpid -l /dev/null just returns: acpid: can't open /proc/acpi/event: Device or resource busy
31512,20.1,To disable acpid logging_DOUHAO_ edit /etc/default/acpid and add "-l /dev/null" to the end of the OPTIONS string.
31512,20.2,On my system_DOUHAO_ the line looks like this with the change: OPTIONS="-s /var/run/acpid.socket -l /dev/null" I am running hardy amd64.
31512,20.3,Once in a while_DOUHAO_ /var/log/apcid gets so large that it quickly consumes all available disk space_DOUHAO_ causing a multitude problems.
31512,20.4,Disabling acpid logging seems to be an effective workaround for this issue as well.
31512,21.1,Please can someone confirm if this has been fixed in Intrepid testing?
31512,21.2,In theory this patch should have been merged from Debian_DOUHAO_ however it is not specifically mentioned in the package changelog.
31512,22.1,Looks fixed to me.
31521,1.1,Network->Channels presents a long list of Freenode channels.
31521,1.2,I believe this list should be tailored to only include Ubuntu related ones (including language specific ones_DOUHAO_ kubuntu channels_DOUHAO_ edubuntu channels_DOUHAO_ etc).
31521,1.3,If this can't be done_DOUHAO_ then at a minimum the Ubuntu related ones should appear at the top of the list.
31521,2.1,User has just to type "ubuntu" in the filter field to see only channels with ubuntu in their names.
31521,2.2,I'm not sure than it would be useful to do that by default.
31521,3.1,This is tricky_DOUHAO_ the list of channels comes from the server and is not fixed.
31521,3.2,We could put some hacks to list the ubuntu chans first but that would break the sorting options by example.
31521,3.3,I'm marling it as low priority but I'm tempted to simply reject it.
31521,3.4,As commented before you can filter on ubuntu easily enough
31521,4.1,I vote for reject too.
31521,4.2,Filtering on "ubuntu" by default just make sens on freenode and i don't think it will be very useful to do that.
31521,4.3,Maybe auto-join the channel of the LOCO team (#ubuntu-fr for exemple) by default would be more interesting.
31521,5.1,I'm closing this.
31521,5.2,If you have strong reason to believe it should be re-opened_DOUHAO_ please do so.
52271,1.1,bzr shows me the missing revisions but fails to merge it in my newly created branch.
52271,1.2,The current branch was created by branching an empty branch (before adding the files).

52271,2.1,revision 0 is only allowed if you explicitly request it with: bzr merge -r 0.

52271,4.5,When you branch before the first commit_DOUHAO_ the two branches have nothing in common.
52271,4.6,None of their files have the same ids_DOUHAO_ etc.
52271,4.7,One could be a Linux tree and the other could be Samba_DOUHAO_ for all we know.

52271,4.11,We believe merging unrelated trees is almost always an accident.
52271,4.12,But in addition_DOUHAO_ you cannot merge in a tree with no commits_DOUHAO_ because the last-committed revision is used to determine the common ancestor with the other branch.
52271,4.13,> Maybe "bzr pull" would do better.
52271,4.14,Pull will not work properly if you've added the files independently in each tree_DOUHAO_ because every time you add a file_DOUHAO_ it's considered unique.

52271,4.17,I agree there's a problem: if you've added the files twice (once in each branch)_DOUHAO_ then we haven't explained the bzr model to you properly.

52271,5.1,I haven't added files twice.
52271,5.2,Why should I?
52271,5.3,I don't need to be tought the bzr model_DOUHAO_ I'm just learning bzr commands.
52271,5.4,I still think that when you can create "a branch of something" and you cannot "merge again"_DOUHAO_ something is wrong.
52271,5.5,You either should not create branches of empty (zero-revision) branches (so the error message belongs to 'bzr branch') or if you can_DOUHAO_ you should be able to merge again (as was written in the documentation).
52271,5.6,I don't know what is better.
52271,5.7,But this way you are prevented to merge *related* branches (related because one is derived from the other).
52271,5.8,The only difference from the usual case is that the files are not yet in the branch (but they will be soon).
52271,5.9,Or would you accidentally use "bzr branch http://_DOUHAO_ _DOUHAO_ _DOUHAO_ _DOUHAO_ " instead of "bzr init"?
52271,5.10,I could have added different files to different derived branches.

52271,6.5,Well_DOUHAO_ it's hard to know what you've done without having seen it.
52271,6.6,I've been assuming you did something like this: bzr init foo bzr branch foo bar bzr tar -xzvf foo-1.2.4.tar.gz -C foo bzr add foo bzr branch bar bzr tar -xzvf foo-devel.tar.gz -C bar bzr add bar bzr commit foo cd bar bzr merge If you simply want to mirror the latest changes from foo to bar_DOUHAO_ then merge is the wrong command to use.
52271,6.7,Merge applies the changes to the working tree only_DOUHAO_ not the branch_DOUHAO_ so you must commit the changes afterward.
52271,6.8,> I don't need to be tought the bzr model_DOUHAO_ I'm just learning bzr commands.
52271,6.9,You can't predict what the commands will do if you don't know the model.
52271,6.10,I'm talking about things like "all files have a unique identity that is created when you 'bzr add' them." That's different from what CVS or Git or Mercurial do.
52271,6.11,> I still think that when you can create "a branch of something" and you > cannot "merge again"_DOUHAO_ something is wrong.
52271,6.12,Merge is a command that takes the changes in another branch_DOUHAO_ combines them with the changes in your local branch_DOUHAO_ and applies the result to your local tree.
52271,6.13,If you don't have any changes comitted in your local branch_DOUHAO_ you get an error about that.
52271,6.14,I don't see that being a big problem.
52271,6.15,> You either should not create branches of empty (zero-revision) branches
52271,6.16,No_DOUHAO_ you should_DOUHAO_ because you can pull such a branch.
52271,6.17,> (so the error message belongs to 'bzr branch') or if you can_DOUHAO_ you should > be able to merge again (as was written in the documentation).
52271,6.18,That may also be true_DOUHAO_ but I think there's also a documentation issue_DOUHAO_ because you should never want to do this anyway.
52271,6.19,
52271,1.,
52271,6.20,If you have not made any changes in the local branch_DOUHAO_ you want pull_DOUHAO_ not merge.
52271,6.21,
52271,2.,
52271,6.22,If you really want merge_DOUHAO_ that usually means the branches are related.
52271,6.23,In this case_DOUHAO_ you will want to have committed at least once before you branch_DOUHAO_ so that the same file has the same identity in each branch.
52271,6.24,Otherwise_DOUHAO_ merge will not combine the changes properly.
52271,6.25,
52271,3.,
52271,6.26,If you really want merge_DOUHAO_ and the branches are not related_DOUHAO_ you must always specify "-r0.
52271,6.27,-1".
52271,6.28,In this case_DOUHAO_ the trees have different files in them_DOUHAO_ and you're not changes to be combined on a per-file level.
52271,6.29,> I don't know what is better.
52271,6.30,But this way you are prevented to merge > *related* branches (related because one is derived from the other).
52271,6.31,If the branches have no common ancestor_DOUHAO_ then there is no way to intelligently combine their changes.
52271,6.32,When they have no common ancestor_DOUHAO_ their files almost never have any identities in common.
52271,6.33,Using "-r0.
52271,6.34,-1" is a way of combining their changes unintelligently_DOUHAO_ which only works well on unrelated trees.
52271,6.35,> The > only difference from the usual case is that the files are not yet in the > branch (but they will be soon).
52271,6.36,The usual case for merge is that both branches have had changes committed to them_DOUHAO_ and you want to combine those changes together.

52271,9.39,So_DOUHAO_ my first commands are_DOUHAO_ "bzr init; bzr pull _DOUHAO_ " and then merge instead of_DOUHAO_ "bzr branch _DOUHAO_ ; bzr merge" and then merge (again).

54369,6.6,Any delay in sending a new bug notification seems unhelpful in the best case (like matsubara's example)_DOUHAO_ and inaccurate in the worst case (like bug 41063 ).
54369,6.7,So_DOUHAO_ I'm curious_DOUHAO_ how do you plan to fix bug 41063 if not to include sending the newbug mail immediately as part of the solution?
54369,7.1,Maybe we could special-case the bug reporter and send him the notification straight away?

54369,8.4,
54369,8.5,Why not special-case the action instead?
54369,8.6,If it's a new bug_DOUHAO_ send a notification straight away.
54369,8.7,If it's an edit_DOUHAO_ send the batched notification after 5 min.

54369,10.3,Well_DOUHAO_ I think that these dont really apply with new-bugs-over mail.
54369,10.4,Because the bug is public immediately anyway_DOUHAO_ and visible on the product page etc.
54369,10.5,and errors in the submission aren't really visible to the submitter if they've used email.

55794,4.3,I dont think Registry should be a requirement - version_info is good_DOUHAO_ Registry just makes it better.

55794,5.1,It isn't a strict requirement.
55794,5.2,But since Registry should land soon_DOUHAO_ I was waiting for it to show up_DOUHAO_ so I can clean up 'version_info' while I'm merging.
55794,5.3,But yes_DOUHAO_ they are independent_DOUHAO_ and version info could be merged first if we get blocked on the Registry stuff.
55794,6.1,related to bug 5275
55794,7.1,The code has been merged_DOUHAO_ awaiting review to see whether it will be 0.11 or 0.12
72501,1.1,xserver-xorg-video-i810 and other video drivers depend on a specific ABI from libdri_DOUHAO_ which should be represented by a depends: entry in the package.
72501,2.1,What is the name of the ABI?
72501,3.1,Ubuntu >xserver-xorg-video-i810
72501,4.1,please dont set this to the individual driver_DOUHAO_ it affects many packages and that will hide it.
72501,4.2,It does not need triage at this point_DOUHAO_ its been filed in conjunction with a relevant developer
72501,5.1,Thanks for reporting this bug in Ubuntu.
72501,5.2,Can you please test to see if it occurs in Feisty or a newer version of Ubuntu?
72501,6.1,Have a chat with Adam Conrad.
72501,6.2,The problem is the libdri ABI is unversioned - or was.
72501,6.3,Its not a matter of testing though_DOUHAO_ because unless there is skew nothing is wrong ;).
72501,8.1,There are a lot of drivers_DOUHAO_ and we only ship one libdri.
72501,8.2,The drivers just have to work with the version we have_DOUHAO_ and Depends does not solve anything.

72501,12.1,Ok_DOUHAO_ let me think about this for a second.
72501,12.2,libdri.so is provided by xserver-xorg-core (source: xorg-server)_DOUHAO_ which happens to conflict with video drivers that do not Provide the correct video driver ABI (currently xserver-xorg-video-2).
72501,12.3,That Provides is generated automatically when the drivers are built against the xserver.
72501,12.4,xorg-server also build-depends on a compliant mesa (which builds libgl1-mesa-dri_DOUHAO_ which contains all the foo_dri.so -drivers).
72501,12.5,So_DOUHAO_ where exactly do we need some extra Depends?

72501,14.8,When we created the bug there was nothing fixing the ABI of libdri.so (which upstream changes without a package change or soname change occuring) to the ABI the video drivers were built against.
72501,14.9,-Rob -- GPG key available at: < http://www.robertcollins.net/keys.txt >.
72501,15.1,Ah_DOUHAO_ ok.
72501,15.2,Closing the bug then.
72501,15.3,The drivers have provided the ABI version before too_DOUHAO_ but perhaps the mesa build-deps were not strict enough when we tracked upstream snapshots.
72501,15.4,Now there is no need to do that anymore.

91330,2.2,Seriously_DOUHAO_ we need more info to see what the cause of this is: Have you checked that in /proc/interrupts your mouse is set and configured correctly?
91330,2.3,Is the relevant module loaded (cat /proc/modules | grep psmouse)?
91330,2.4,Is any relevant error/warning reported in the xorg log file (/var/log/Xorg.0.log)?

91330,7.1,I confirm that there is something fishy about the mouse behaviour in 2.6.20.
91330,7.2,The kernel FAQ ( http://kerneltrap.org/node/2199 ) doesn't unfortunately cover this case.
91330,7.3,If I plug in my mouse through a USB->PS/2 adapter the mouse is not detected by the kernel.
91330,7.4,Instead I get a Macintosh mouse button emulation as /class/input/input0 !?

91330,15.1,Hi Cesare_DOUHAO_ based on the fact that it doesn't work in other OSs_DOUHAO_ I'm rejecting this for the moment :) Where did you get the USB->PS/2 adapter from?
91330,15.2,Normally these connectors are normally passive (they just change the shape of the plug)_DOUHAO_ the actual computer chip within the mouse is responsible for detecting where it is plugged into a USB_DOUHAO_ or to a PS/2 protocol socket.
91330,15.3,If the mouse wasn't built and supplied with a converter on the end of the cable it won't work as the intelligence is not available within the mouse to be able to speak PS/2 protocol in the first place.
91330,15.4,Do you have another mouse that you can try?
91330,16.1,Sorry_DOUHAO_ I said 'Cesare' when I meant the original reporter_DOUHAO_ 'Manuel'.
96147,1.1,I found that USB to serial dongles such as my FTDI chipset (ftdi_sio driver) dongle no longer work in Feisty.
96147,1.2,The problem is that brltty claims them before the driver is able to_DOUHAO_ as I understand it:
96147,1.3,[ 6786.276000] usb 1-1.4: usbfs: interface 0 claimed by ftdi_sio while 'brltty' sets config #1 [ 6786.284000] ftdi_sio ttyUSB0: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now disconnected from ttyUSB0 [ 6786.288000] ftdi_sio 1-1.4:1.0: device disconnected
96147,1.4,Removing the brltty and brltty-x11 packages solved the problem.
96147,1.5,It seems that either this package needs to be fixed so that it doesn't interfere with these devices or it maybe shouldn't be installed by default?
96147,2.1,Same problem here with TMote Sky sensor motes ( http://www.moteiv.com/products/tmotesky.php ).
96147,2.2,This is what happens when I try to plug one
96147,3.1,noting package name and marking confirmed since others can reproduce it_DOUHAO_
96147,4.1,Note: yes it should always be installed by default_DOUHAO_ because it is meant for blind users to be able to use their computer.
96147,4.2,Without it_DOUHAO_ they wouldn't be able to even run apt-get or synaptic_DOUHAO_ So the solution is really to remove the guilty USB ID from the hotplug/udev rule.
96147,5.1,This is still a problem on Gutsy.
96147,5.2,It's highly annoying_DOUHAO_ any serial USB device (for instance USB to serial adapters_DOUHAO_ but also the Artec Group's LPC dongle) is affected by this.
96147,5.3,Can this *please* be fixed?
96147,5.4,Is there a way to detect brltty hardware in a more intelligent way_DOUHAO_ and not just attach to anything that looks like a USB serial device?
96147,6.1,This problem isn't only on ubuntu_DOUHAO_ it's on debian as well_DOUHAO_ should a bug report be made there_DOUHAO_ too?
96147,6.2,Shouldn't packages be checked for faults like these?

96147,7.3,I don't think so: on debian brltty is _not_ installed by default_DOUHAO_ only people having braille displays would install it.
96147,7.4,The combination of owning both a USB serial dongle _and_ a braille display is very rare and such people would know how to tackle it anyway.
96147,7.5,> Shouldn't packages be checked for faults like these?
96147,7.6,Ideally yes_DOUHAO_ but it's hard to track that automatically: you'd have to somehow parse the source code to know which identifiers are used.

98893,4.1,There seems to be an internal issue with the USB device management.
98893,4.2,I have disconnected all usb devices i got_DOUHAO_ except for the mouse (Logitech MX 1000 Laser) and the keyboard (Fujitsu Siemens 105 keys Swedish layout).
98893,4.3,Same thing_DOUHAO_ during boot or installation_DOUHAO_ it get stuck at Hal hald.
98893,4.4,I gives me some error lines during boot as: [ bunch of numbers] USB 1-4: Device descriptor read/64_DOUHAO_ error -71 [ bunch of numbers] USB 1-4: Device not accepting adress XX_DOUHAO_ error -71 (XX is instead of adress) Repatedly_DOUHAO_ giong through all the 128 adresses there is in usb devices_DOUHAO_ and finaly it says: Hal exited with return code 2.

98893,4.7,Now_DOUHAO_ I upgraded earlier tonight from Edgy to feisty through update-manager -d_DOUHAO_ worked fine_DOUHAO_ until I reboot and start up the system_DOUHAO_ I can get in to desktop by running in recovery mode_DOUHAO_ and type startx.
98893,4.8,But i tried to follow the hal debug output directions_DOUHAO_ but it doesnt happens as described there and theres no flood of messages at all when i disconnect the devices_DOUHAO_ type the lines as described for Breezy and Dapper_DOUHAO_ and reconnect the mouse and keyboard.
98893,4.9,Im not very good at Linux and the terminal_DOUHAO_ so I am a bit clueless right now.

98893,5.3,Oh_DOUHAO_ this suggests a kernel bug_DOUHAO_ but that is unrelated to the hal issue.

98893,5.5,Oh_DOUHAO_ you do not need to disconnect any device_DOUHAO_ in fact you should not.
98893,5.6,You do not need to do the first 13 steps (which is for debugging failing USB key automounting and the like)_DOUHAO_ but the second set of instructions (below 'However_DOUHAO_ you might be asked for a "hal debug output") (7 steps).
98893,5.7,Thank you!
98893,6.1,Not sure if it is this you are askin for?
