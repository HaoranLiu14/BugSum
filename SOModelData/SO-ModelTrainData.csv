i couldn't figure out a more useful way to debug this.,0
the edgy live-cd works very well for me.,1
"Well, considering I wasn't able to describe how to reproduce the bug in the original report, and noting that the original report was almost five years ago, I could not possibly even begin to confirm the continued existence of the bug right now.",0
I'm on this.,1

possible the new packege is not updated on all mirrors yet.,0
"Normally, all bugs on kernels must have some information described at: But because of the nature of the bug report, I am confirming without it.",1
I've installed it from the ppa (on jaunty) and restarted firefox but don't see the extension listed in the add-ons.,0
"Martin, Actually I have done some more testing and discovered that when index merging no physical reads were done (they are all cache hits) so ext3 problem is handling a ton of small writes",1

issue still seen on Gutsy Beta with Dell Dimension 3000 onboard audio card,0
"tried solution suggested by danielhollocher, it worked",1
After reading again and just have followed a forum link in Ubuntu Forums i saw i maybe have chosen the wrong bug to comment. Sorry !,0
I think I have found a fix for the issue of the garbage at the right/bottom when forcing compiz to start despite the failed texture size.,1
i don't have a focus problem in ubuntu 9.04 jaunty alpha 5.,0
I had the same problem described.,1
this log doesn't look like the latest.,0
I had the same problem with my T60.,1
I still can't change my screen resolution.,0
"@Jacob: -i810 and -intel have a different codebase, both need to get fixed and both work now. There is a bug in the intel driver though that makes video playback crash on older cards (i830, i915), but those cards work fine with the i810 driver.",1
unfortunately it had some bad side effects that caused breakage for people and had to back the patch out.,0
"the fix works for me, but since we are moving this to 3.7.1 i will hold off on my +1.",1
"However, when trying to compile the driver, as explained by ggepz, it fails with many errors.",0
I can just say that I have the same problem. The disabling of the exchange operations plugin does not help.,1
This is still broken in karmic.,0
"this patch is quite nice because it makes the markup more consistent and it allows someone to set the toolbar mode, possibly attach a palette, and so on..",1
"No, unfortunately the display-brightness problem still remains - at least I didn't manage to make it work.",0
"It is a definite improvement though, no question.",1
"It is compatible to the kernel, but it needs a newer python-launchpad-bugs in Feisty. Also, I am not terribly convinced that we need it in feisty, since we disabled the automatic crash notification by default.",0
the above attached patch solves this bug.,1
i'm sorry but i can't test this fix.,0
"comment on attachment 525331 new version with a working test i agree that changing the test should make the test pass, but it seems like window.close() being invoked inside a content window is still a thing that can happen and should also be tested",1
This problem is still very annoying to me on Lucid.,0
Solution that works for me,1
slayer: It has been over a year with no solution for this bug.,0
This now works for me in Jaunty as of yesterday afternoon/evening.,1
doesn't work in edgy rc1.,0
"OK, it looks like the problem is fixed for me in both the stock 2.6.35 and +iofix provided by Brian Rogers. There's still [kdmflush] and a bunch of other programs causing a lot of I/O wait (according to top and iotop), but the system is MUCH more responsive. Usually when the problem occurred, the HDD light would go solid for several moments before I could use my system again. Now, the pause is brief, much less than two seconds if it ceases being responsive at all. I mentioned earlier that the problem still occurred shortly after boot, but that was the HDD light I was referring to, not the perceived responsiveness of the system. So for me, the solution is to upgrade to 2.6.35.",1
Because I have packages installed from a PPA I get an error and can't continue with the upgrade.,0
"In all cases, the broken I/O has been fixed by the mainline kernel install.",1
"i tried to add another file and finish the session, but that didn't work either.",0
"Thanks for your bugreport, fixed in my local branch and will be part of the next upload. Cheers, Michael",1
"That's a 2.6.35 kernel, and Lucid has a 2.6.32 kernel by default. So you can't tell whether 2.6.35 or the patches I added on top of it solved the problem, unless you also test the unpatched 2.6.35.",0
"i have the same issue, compiz dies if it's larger than 2048.",1
this is not an nvidia problem as the same happens to me with ati's fglrx 8-2 if i try to use aiglx.,0
"well, i believe you are right in the sense that if the folder to which you are downloading the video is currently open/visible, the thumbnailer tries to update the thumbnail and go crazy.",1
"I've installed the iofix+19.28 kernel for Lucid from Brian Rogers. So far, it seems to work. When the machine is booting up, it still seems to have the problem, however. iotop (which now works appropriately) reports the [kdmflush] service as consuming 99.99% I/O when the system is unresponsive, but I haven't noticed it in the past 24hrs or so (my uptime is less than 48hrs currently). I will continue to monitor, and I'll post back with results.",0
"yes, seems to be really fixed. Thanks Michael for the patch and the upload.",1
"oddly, i can't confirm those observations.",0
"I got this today too, but for me it works after the panel gets restarted.",1
"It's not a question of stablility, WebKit would have to be in main for Epiphany to be able to built with it. WebKit is not a candidate for main yet, and probably won't be until KDE start requiring it for KDE 4.1.",0

"Thank you for your help, but I still have the problem.",0
Thanks to Patrick for the package. I tested it under Hardy Heron with my Sony Vaio SZ4MN integrated webcam and can confirm it works very well.,1

martin: your workaround works for me!,1
"Applets should not be larger than the viewable area, if there's an applet above it, then the lower applet should get a smaller sizehint, and resize if necessary when it's the active applet (and therefore the only one on the screen)",0

"i'm not using nv, i use the nvidia driver, but that is beside the point.",0
This recently became fixed for me.,1
Your information did not get attached to the bug report.,0
"Yes, that's true -- the current graphing code, which uses the graphical library \""Guppi\"" which is a dead project, can only produce the on-screen diagrams *and* print these to postscript, but it cannot export these diagrams into pictures that are embedded in a HTML-file.",1

I'm having the same issue. Only just noticed today.,1
I'm not convinced this is a xubuntu bug.,0
"Anyway, I agree with you in that it sounds stupid that rebuilding the",1
so that isn't the problem with mine i think.,0
yes that's true the bug is still there but at least both packages are in the repos...,1
thi is not a solution.,0
It fixed the problem for me too.,1
"Well not so easy since there are problems with wi-fi, but since I'm using a live usb with some free space for changes,",0
"The cause of the problem is known, and the Ubuntu guys will release a fix soon enough. This will probably either be rebuilding linux-ubuntu-modules with some new compile flags, or with a complete kernel rebuild and some patches",1
"During the connection dialog, however, I get the same message ""Cannot get information from the serial port."" maybe because usb is not a ""regular"" serial port.",0
i agree with what mike said - we (it) do a lot of last minute work and would have been able to handle this one too.,1
"I don't think they have xulrunner-1.9 in debian, so lets wait for this and see what we get.",0
Problem seems to have been dissapeared. I tested on a clear 7.10.beta install and no problems anymore,1
"Okay, but your mockups are bad (I hope you do not take any offense, because its a great idea!).",0
"Yes, this has been fixed for me as well since the final release.",1
That is a different bug and has already been reported.,0
"I get the same problem described by DanM for ""sleep"", and the same problem described in the original post for hibernation (screen flicks on an off).",1
No it doesn't make sense to me either when you put it that way.,0
i can confirm this.,1

I am facing the same issue with Hardy Heron on my HP laptop (Compaq nx6120).,1

"grub cannot see the usb keyboard, there is no option in the bios for legacy keyboard or any other options for that matter.",0
"I have the same problem, i was going to buy a 4965AGN wifi card anyway so i will see if that fixes the problem.",1
I still won't consider this bug closed though..,0
Another useful datapoint is that the submitter of #197183 claims that this worked in Dapper.,1
I at least can't reproduce it with a simple checkout.,0
i think it would be reasonable to put the mdadm patch before this delay also.,1

uploaded to gutsy-proposed. Thanks for your contribution.,1

"Ah, now that is interesting. I'll ask our python-apt guru about this.",1
the above fix proposed by archdrone also works for the hp compaq 2510p (just change the c098 with c099).,1
same here and works for me too : ),1

The fglrx hang should be fixed with the latest fglrx. glxgears are useful to verify its working,1

i can confirm this problem.,1

It would help us greatly if you could test with it so we can work on getting it fixed in the next release of Ubuntu.,1
i don't think targeting it for edgy-upgrades is the right thing to do and we did never had the need to run it twice before.,0
I think Tormod hit the nail on the head on that (but I don't know blkid internals too).,1

it is not the same bug.,0
it also occures to me,1
Fixing this by Rosetta would have been impossible as there is no search.,0

the latest version in feisty does fix this issue.,1

Hi Marco I tried that as it was mentioned in the fixes above but still no joy! It'll work if I turn desktop effects off but not when enabled.,0
keulieminogue : Thank your very much for your confirmation.,1
I still can't reproduce anymore here - maybe your mirror is behind or this issue is one that is very hardware/settings specific.,0

"I compiled Banshee 1.2.1 today, but still no luck.",0
Sound on the D830 be fixed by using a newer version of ALSA: make sure you have all requirements to build the kernel,1
"Still having this same problem on a new Hardy beta install, using 2 drives in a RAID-1 mirror.",0
I own a Lenovo 3000V100 which I have now upgraded to Gutsy and faced the same problem (while this was not a problem in the prev version).,1
"Martin, unfortunately users are always suggested to uncheck any third-party repositories before upgrading to a new release.",0
"@David Tombs: Yeah, you're right, I was thinking it was a symptom of the same problem.",1
"waddayaknow, previous comment was not entirely correct.",0
I need to confirm what Arthur Furlan told. I also had this problem of waiting a long long time before the quit window comes.,1
i'd say it doesn't make much sense to read xorg.conf.,0
"Yep I did a clean install of 7.10,. And it's still slow like",1
This bug shouldn't have priority 'low'.,0
i've just tried it out in feisty and it works!,1
"hmm, i can't repriduce this with gnome-terminal, firefox or evolution.",0
"daniel, i agree with you that it should work the same for the user on all applications, but i'm not sure who is responsible for making this sort of decision.",1
"Xinerama is no longer available at all, not because of a driver issue, but because the whole X.org architecture changed in version 7.2.",0
"Problem still exists exactly as described, workaround does the job though.",1
"Suspend and hibernate do NOT work with the backport module for me either (on D830), but as Julian says, 1.0.15rc1 works perfectly. I will stick to compiling my own module as it seems.",0
"@arand Thanks for all of the data, that helps a lot.",1
sometimes when I reboot X server copiz crashes. I dont think it ever crashes after a full restart.,0
Problem solved. Thank your for your quick response.,1
"Sorry for bringing this up again... I have to write down things that need to be done... I forgot to remove the ""draft"" status from ""sect1""...",0
Verified. This fix works for me as well using gutsy-alternate-i386.iso Tribe 2 release for installation in (k)qemu.,1
"hi davur, i think the white-screen issue is a different bug.",0
"Me too same problem - I'm running Linux Mint OS, and Evolution mail.",1
"No need to keep flooding the maintainers with comments, this bug has been confirmed and will be fixed soon as stated",0
Mark - thanks for the suggestion. This patch solves the above patch's problems.,1
"Sorry about spamming this bug, but I can't even turn off suspend/hibernate/shutdown from the battery preferences",0
i can confirm that ulfzart's solution (editing /etc/usplash.conf and doing update-initramfs) fixes it for me.,1
"not available, unsubscribing u-u-s.",0
"In the interest of having this out quicker, I'd like to highlight that JDT is very easy to install using P2 (Eclipse's new package manager.) So I think the only component that needs to be included in the .deb is the platform, and the nice .xpm icon.",1
"Bart, I could not find libqopensync0 at http://packages.ubuntu.com/ (in any previous Ubuntu release).",0
"Appears to be working with hardy final, yes.",1
"The kernel does detect the insertion, but no device is associated with it, the card is not mounted.",0
"roland, your suggestion solved the problem for me!",1
i can't get dmraid_0.9.9-1.0.0.rc13-0ubuntu1_i386.deb to function correctly.,0
"Although this solution is good for Gutsy, I think that for Hardy it'd be better to update the libfaad2 and libmp4v2 packages.",1
"This is not a feature request, this is a bug! The computer behaves in a totally unexpected way, and a way that is not very useful.",0
"After upgrade from Ubuntu 8.04 to 8.10 I encountered the same problem - slow disk access, it takes long for applications to start.",1
No as it was before on a clean install too. But it is gone for me.,0
The Inspiron 1420 is not affected. Sound is fine on mine (has been ok for a while).,1
when pressing ok again after some time passed by a conflict warning is shown. the conflict cannot be resolved by deciding for either (or both) dates,0
It fixed the problem for me too.,1
This bug affects my Lenovo x60 Tablet. Brightness does not work as to the scale either.,0
"After some digging, somehow this solves the problem",1
"It's not available for Hardy (or anything prior to Intrepid, rather) at this time.",0
"I can confirm the advice from Roger, thanks a lot!",1
This bug is still missing a complete dmesg and the output of lspci -vvnn,0
"I agree with Krzysztof Kosiski, this is not something that would make Ubuntu better, but a bug.",1
"of surprising, sounds unpolished Well, the name of this package is not open for discussion here. This is about package description.",0
"Same problem on Gutsy and it's Jan 9th, 2008",1
Not sure that it should matter whether you use persistent mode or not though.,0
"Thanks for the dmesg output, I will fix that ASAP.",1
I'm sometimes told my Latitude D830 has no battery in it which is clearly bogus. Never seen this with Feisty.,0
i have exactly the same problem on my msi vr610 new laptop with: ati technologies inc sb600 non-raid-5 sata 100% same situation as it was descripted above!,1
"you shouldn t have to use the decorating classes directly, just how they use treewalk s and dircacheentry s getrawmode to get the different statuses.",0
i agree with davegod75.,1
This is still happening for me too in (Kubuntu) Gutsy RC. Quite annoying.,0
"Hi Justin, I think that's a bit too simple. My annoyance is that when the setting is set to idle, it doesn't go back to *where it was,* but to some default value",1
perhaps your package mirror hasn't been synced yet and you run an older version of update-manager.,0
"Well, a broken package is very stable... :) Yes, in this case, the system is what is broken.",1
"i can reproduce your issue, however it's not the same as the one described in this bug report.",0
"it looks good, and i verified that it works for internal and external jars, and that it doesn t break bug 297039",1
I really hate sidebars and would want to be able to disable them in place of these windows before I would migrate to Firefox.,0
"Thanks, Adrien. I assumed I could do that",1
I don't think this bug is SATA related.,0
i agree with mads's comment in regards to importance.,1
"This fixes the problem, but isn't quite correct...",0
i agree with ?skar in that this should have a higher priority - it's a real showstopper for some of us!,1
"#25 marius, your bug is not related with this one.",0
I agree that this bug makes ubuntu look pretty bad for anyone who wants to type multiple languages.,1
"you can enable it, but you won't get starting sound at all.",0
"As John Little also wrote, my Amarok's setting is pointing to /dev/cdrom. I've got the same error both when starting from the KDE autoplay daemon or directly from Amarok.",1
"I don't use evolution and so don't see the relation. Still, update notifier dies several times a day of its own volition. I've killed all of the evolution processes just in case. Will keep an eye on it.",0
"Conn: Yes, EXA is just becoming really usable and I doubt there will be backports for gutsy since it might break other setups. So I'm marking this as fixed in Hardy.",1
rhythmbox shouldn't display shares it doesn't support.,0
I see the exact same problem on my Thinkpad T41p with ATI Mobility Fire GL T2.,1
$ sudo pppoeconf this option is not available.,0
"Hi, I've already got all this ready to upload...",1
that doesn't seem to make a difference.,0
That solved my problem.,1
this workaround does not work for me as i dont have the following file on my system: /etc/xdg/menus/debian-menu.menu on my system.,0
"@martin I do believe it is a showstopper, as it also breaks Adobe's flash plugin inside konqueror/nspluginviewer.",1
"Sorry guys, lack of due diligence on this one (and it being past my bedtime). The single change was to avoid having to file an exception for a newer version",0
"Yes, agreed the pref is not ideal for this purpose.",1
I mean it's not here,0
"Here's the same for wxwidgets2.8. This issue should be fixed next release 2.8.5.0, but in the mean time this should probably be applied for applications that use newer wxw.",1
"this bug is not fixed, it should be reopened, and is in serious discussion upstream.",0
"Same for me, and this one is a fresh install.",1
"There's no way to probe most CD drives without generating interrupts, so there's nothing hal can do about this.",0
john's proposal in comment #2 is also acceptable.,1
"Disabling acpi did nothing. Still always on AC, according to this. Gutsy release out, no fix, not impressed.",0
I got the same issue.,1
"sadly, turning of acpi & hpet did not work.",0
the fix looks ok to me but i can t guarantee that there are no unwanted side effects,1
"Oh, and drag-and-drop never works for me.",0
i'm also running ubuntu 8.10 (intrepid ibex) on a hp pavilion dv5 (dv5-1075er) and seems i have exactly the same problem that guilhem lavaux does.,1
"it's odd, but the patch file itself doesn't have any indication inside it as to which projects the patch changes apply. this seems like an egit bug to me",0
"If sound stops working after suspend-to-ram or suspend-to-disk, try the workaround specified at . This works on Gutsy. Only thing about it is that upon resuming, you may get a pop-up window about Volume Control quitting unexpectedly, just click Reload and you're fine.",1
dincer but this is not what we want.,0
"I experienced this too, but in my case all the Evolution parts crashed and I also lost all my todos.",1
"unfortunately we can't fix it, because your description didn't include enough information.",0
i have the same problem in dapper drake (ubuntu 6.06).,1
i tried both use bash 3.1 and replace %q strings with %b and none of the workarounds solved the problem.,0
The issue also occurs with kernel 2.6.24.3 of today.,1
I installed Tribe 4 today. Still the same: the ACX files are there but the wireless does not show up in the network configurator.,0
same problem for me also...,1
it still doesn't work. i can't even get keycode using xev.,0
"Fixes things here, thanks a ton!",1
"This of course, won't work as lrm-video is part of the restricted modules package.",0
"right. while i was looking at the code, i became confused as well. i agree that we have to take a good look at it.",1
"Ted Gould, I tried out your package, and when I move the brightness slider in gnome-power-preferences, nothing happens. It seems like this is the problem",0
"I saw your post on the ubuntu forums, I installed SPE 0.8.2.a as per your instructions, and it looks like it works for me.",1
I've installed 2.9.0-1ubuntu3 from Martin-éric's PPA and I'm still having the same problem. Blinking cursor instead of X. I can't get into a terminal in the thin client to see any error messages either.,0
"Martin - oops. What I meant was that the package in -proposed is the correct one, e.g., it fixes the resolution issues.",1
I have a Microsoft Wireless 5000 mouse and this issue makes it nearly impossible to use the wheel fro scrolling.,0
"I agree, thanks again for your work on this Martin.",1
"Sergey, that looks like a different problem",0
"Daedalus, Yes, your testing and observations match with mine.",1
I don't really understand this bug report,0
"Hi, same thing here. Let me summarize the problem and workarounds",1
"We are not going to fix unix zoneinfo databases, which currently return ('EST', 'EST') for eastern Australia, thus making time.",0
were having the same problem on boot,1
"however, it doesn't seem terribly hardware accelerated.",0
I just want to add that I've got the exact same problem as Alan Pope.,1
"dotty, this cannot be fixed with python code.",0
i totally agree with unggnu that priority of this bug should be higher.,1
"unfortunately we can't fix it, because your description does not yet have enough information.",0
"Tank you, Thank you & thrice Thank you! You have fixed it & I can now use my Micro$oft trackball in Firefox as I want it to work",1
this bug is still not fixed.,0
performace is fine for me.,1
"Martin, I see your point when you're saying that the \""common standard\"" should be as good as possible, however I would rather not to filter any lines from a patch when parsing.",0
"I have switched to KDE from Gnome because Gnome was taking too long to start up, and this did fix the problem for me. So I think it is a problem related to Gnome.",1
"Sorry, the penultimate paragraph above is probably wrong, since auth.log would normally exist at boot time, with mode 640.",0
Leann correctly marked my bug (141339) as a duplicate of this one.,1
"Just a quick update: @Andres, it is not the same, just similar.",0
It would be great if you could test with the LiveCD for this new release and let us know your results.,1
I don't think there's a single fix which will fix both cases.,0
everything else seems to work ok.,1
There is no way to see the final line or two in the lyrics applet.,0
This bug is triggered for me too if I disable gnome-power-manager in my session. I have reproduced it with both Gutsy and alpha 5 of Hardy.,1
"I cannot reproduce it on fresh install on the other box, so it has to be some upgrade problem.",0
"I'm using the T61 with Debian Etch, Kernel 2.6.18-5-686 and I have the exact same problem.",1
"not really. in the absence of a fix for 493276, content should reside on some other moco server.",0
"> Andy Whitcroft Yes, I have a Dimension 9200. Running Intrepid w/ all updates & have the latest BIOS Version: 2.5.3. I can shutdown, but not restart.",1
"Still not a duplicate of #140668 (see above). Please stop sending me irrelevant emails, and please keep separate issues separate so they can be fixed.",0
I have same problem with a Dell Latitude D610 ( Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corporation 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6 Family) AC'97 Audio Controller),1
"sorry - libglib, not libg.",0
Hi there!! I was facing the same problem of you guys.,1
from what i know apt/synaptic/aptitude don't give an easy way to automatically downgrade something,0
I agree that the message in the properties form is a pain.,1
"tried that but with the patch applied, basket does not show up in the list of components even for a new user.",0
Experienced this problem while using Pidgin today.,1
"i couldn't see an amd64 version to download, or maybe i'm misinterpreting the versioning.",0
"Sponsored and accepted into gutsy-proposed, please test. Bryce, this has been stalled for a long time.",1
Not working as expected under 2.6.22-14-generic,0
Tested lupin-support_0.16+locale113_all.deb. It works fine,1
"I have the same problem with 2.6.22-11 on a D830. Under the latest version of 2.6.22-10 I could get everything to work if in installed the kernel version of the snd-hda-intel module instead of the one from the linux-ubuntu-module package. However, in 2.6.22-11 the kernel version does not exist and so I can not get any sound to work in 2.6.22-11.",0
"Mandriva One 2008 makes it work out of the box (at least in my case, see my previous post).",1
The title position isn't correct also. It's much above the bar.,0
"Confirmed as well. I use Hardy Final now, had the Problem from the start because I upgraded from Gutsy and had the gnome-power-manager disabled before already.",1
it still does not work for me on an updated kubuntu edgy.,0
"Yes, agreed the pref is not ideal for this purpose.",1
2.6.30 doesn't work for me.,0
The proposed workaround solved the issue for me !,1
"I can only assume that WebKit will be moving to main, otherwise, Ephy won't build now.",0
"I also have the no sound issue with my Lenovo 3000 n100, 0768-a52.",1
"my windows partitions don't get desktop icons, and the desktop theme looks rather old-fashioned.",0
i assume your workarounds are still viable,1
"I've repartitioned/reformatted the card on feisty, where it continues to work ok, but on gutsy I still have I/O-errors on dmesg..",0
PS. The Patch from Matthijs works for me.,1
"muzuiget's patch is similar to the previous patch in mechanism, this will not work all the time.",0
"I get the same error (I guess) as Tim, using your package:",1
"leonardo, your bug has nothing to do with this one.",0
"for me yes, and since it ' s limited scope i would probably not even add a toolbar button but simply add it to the view menu.",1
I still have that crash in /var/crash. I'm reluctant to upload it though as it most likely has secrets,0
everything else seems to work ok.,1
"Please do not re-file bugs. If the metacity devs wont fix it , the papercuts team cannot do it either,",0
"Yes, I think it is similar bug.",1
"no, it doesn't work, it only works on reboot, but not on a new start...",0
"I got the update this morning and can confirm it fixes the problem, which I had reproduced just before.",1
"I should note that I have root on lvm also, but I don't have any further problems. I don't have any other filesystems mounted automatically, though",0
"elyk: Yes, it broke it for me. I'm on a Dell Latitude D630. Annoying. :P",1
I've tested the package on Hardy Heron on my Vaio VGN-FZ11e and it doesn't work,0
Me too! Although: I did also delete the .update-manager* dirs from my home folder. At least it works!,1
"also, in this version i was never able to see an appointment (as red box, was possible previously).",0
"I'd like to confirm this issue on my system that my printer on Gutsy won't work even with the latest update. Also, I'd like to confirm Sa?vann Carignan's workaround which got my printers working again.",1
"shaun, you have an intel so this bug is not really for you.",0
"Joshua, We are still working on some infrastructure changes for accommodating signing-keys for all PPAs. It should happen next week.",1
So only for me it is not fixed!,0
Actually I solved problem. My loopback network interface was misconfigured.,1
My rt73 chipset shows no noticeable improvement using the test v4.,0
I also have the same problem.,1
"It looks like you are also counting empty lines, which doesn't seem overly useful to me.",0
i tested the patch and it works as expected,1
"Source package changed to -2.6.24, this probem repeats in Hardy again (and in -2.6.22 also wasn't fixed).",0
"Ok, done this sudo apt-get install build-essential and then the c compilation worked and then the audio works perfectly! Fantastic!",1
"The recipe give by Daniel Moyne of just touching the file to the epoch does not work for me, neither does the one from ysth. mvo's patch does fix it.",0
I also have the same problem.,1
It is no longer possible to do so since the whole window doesn't fit.,0
"Hi Theodore, Yes, even after a reimage the issue still happens.",1
"Also, I do not see the relevance of the debbug 385181 to my original problem.",0
i think this would always be a good option.,1

"On my machine, it won't resume from suspend to RAM with rc2 but rc1.",1

Sebastien - I looked through your attachment and did not find any sensitive,0
"For a laugh and a half, I decided to delete everything in Rhythmbox and rescan the music folder AND I can reproduce the problem again.",1

"Sorry, I could not reproduce this on Tiger either.",0
"Rohan, thanks for testing and the update. I'm glad to hear things are working for you with the Hardy Alpha release. I'm going to go ahead and close this report for now. Chris and fishor, if you guys are still having issues with the latest Hardy kernel care to open a new bug report? Thanks!",1

The desktop icon is the official one and it is different from the icon inside thunderbird,0
"Same here with a Lenovo 3000 N100 (0768-6EU). And I confirm what lusepuster said, it works with kernel, 2.6.20-15.",1
nvidia themselves aren't much help; i need to follow up with them.,0
"i have also confirmed now, that it occurs with either the gnome or kde desktop.",1
"Albert, you completely misunderstood this.",0
I can confirm that the fix is good i'm using it now without any problems (that i know of anyway ;P),1

I am confirming this bug since another user reported the same problem,1
it didnt do any good.,0
"Let me first say, I am really impressed with gideon. It shows a lot of potential! I am really looking forward to the stable releases.",1
I cannot think why the behavior might depend on what is running on the terminal.,0
"thanks, it works for me as well...",1
this doesn't sound like it is the same problem that i'm seeing.,0
maybe you're right and we should move this to a different bug and start from scratch.,1
so it seems not related to the drive ( Asus Quietrack) I was not able to produce a backtrace. Kde bugtrace crashed too. Best regards David,0
"comment on attachment 555658 thunderbird patch v1 this looks fine, although there may be some ambiguity between whether we are just indexing messages really slowly or are working some other type of jobs",1
"i thought that with the ubuntu 8,10 the problem came resolved, instead not.",0
As reported by me and Jayhawk this bug has been fixed in the 8.04 release. So I think we could close this report.,1
de oliveira: you are seeing a different bug than this one.,0
"I'm trying to package 2.20.2, which requires me to run autoreconf to update 99_autoreconf.patch. Any advice would be much appreciated.",1
not everything is ok as i expected.,0

Oh! I am sorry! I was wrong. it is not available in intrepid!,0

"Hi Chris, ok, what i see is that network manager uses wpa_supplicant to setup network, but never receives any association event back.",0
i completely agree with mat.,1

the fix looks ok to me but i can t guarantee that there are no unwanted side effects,1
"2.2.8, still doesn't have this needed feature... Frustration also confirmed.",0

you're right ... this bug depends of 362539 and not a dupe,1
i did not take it as such.,0
"I tried it last week and it worked ok forme - wow, thanks!",1

I agree with others that you should be able to change it in the Mouse settings.,1
You don't have to nominate it for the current development version.,0

I tried to reproduce this issue but without success so far.,0
So I agree - in general we should only eject those devices which NEED ejection - ipods and the like - but those which can be happily unmounted - usb flash and hard drives to name a few - should NOT require eject...,1
"honestly, i don't believe we can fix it in feisty.",0
"I have a Dell Vostro 1500 which is in the same situation as most of the laptops here. Sound worked with Tribe 5 but 'apt-get dist-upgrade' broke it. I haven't finished downloading Beta yet.

"I can confirm this! When I tried to switch from one to another I saw much faster throughput for a short period, then it would die off.",1

It clearly doesn't follow guidelines. At least not when it comes to respecting languages and culture.,0
The new linux-backports-modules package seems to solve the problem here on a Dell Latitude D830.,1

"unfortunately this wont work here (dapper), the package resolution of the installation script seems not to work properly, and i cant fix this.",0
i'm confirming this problem with hardy alpha-2 on asus a8js and on gutsy everything runned fine.,1
I've just found something odd,0
I have just tested it and it works fine. Thank you.,1
And I don't have unclutter running or even installed (Ubuntu 64 9.10),0
Hello! Same problem with Ubuntu Gutsy Tribe 5 with firefox and thunderbird,1
I didn't use nvidia and I have this problem.,0
I've been having the same issue since Feisty.,1
"Sorry Alex, I'm getting that script failing in several way, lots of syntax trouble.",0
I have exactly same trouble on a nVidia card,1
it seems that my problem and the problem of xandl12 are not related.,0
"Sepang audio works using Realtek's latest drivers, including record. We would prefer a backport, and are looking to find the module which we need to investigate by process of elimination.",1
not the only one - I've got this too,0
"I had feisty installed on my HP Pavillion Laptop, and migrated to Gutsy, everything worked o.k",1
It seems to be fixed. I didnt realize the package had been updated.,0
I have the same problem in Ubuntu 9.04 using evolution 2.26.1.,1
Ditto: no sound on D830 with Kubuntu Gutsy Tribe 5 i386. There was one little change over this week end,0
Same here - and no bluetooth devices!,1
"It 's not a really new issue, it started more than one week ago but I forgot to report it",0
"Looks like this bug has been fixed in Hardy and involves Gutsy only. The attached debdiff (based on Milan's patch) fixes this issue. Built, installed and tested.",1
Steve - Its unlikely unless it gets fixed upstream with ALSA 1.17 which eventually get backported to Hardy LBM.,0
confirm: steve's workaround works for me in gutsy.,1
psypher: Turning off swap definitely doesn't help for me as I've tried it with or without swap.,0
"On my Latitude D630 Sound is working too. The nonlinear volume Control appears here too, but this is an other issue. I think.",1
Sorry to have further muddied the waters. I would suggest using this issue to deal with problems specifically related to this IDE controller. I again apologize for adding to the confusion with my previous post.,0
I just tested with the daily live CD (version 2008-03-19). I was able to duplicate the problem.,1
I can't check this problem anymore because the computer that was mentioned in the original post was thrown away a long time ago.,0
"Sounds fine to me, I guess...",1
"As mentioned in the upstream bug report, the sound problem is intermittent. Mostly, it doesn't work. But even when I do get sound, I cannot capture and get the same message mentioned by Burt.",0
Adam: I can confirm the behaviour you describe with kernels before May (e.g. 2.6.22). The problem seems to have been fixed in later 2.6.26 kernels.,1
"this is just imho, but personally i don't see much value in a ""resize"" (or hdv) button.",0
I can confirm this problem on Asus eee 1000H. It is detected as Logitech wheelmouse.,1
i see that this is the only solution but that will harm a lot of themes including mine that has created the window border design for one pixel width.,0
"Oliver is perfectly right about the gdm, due to my present problems with using ldm I am very much up to date on how to setup gdm 8-) Best, r.r.",1
it does not seem like there will be a fix in feisty ...,0
The same happened to me. I am running Gutsy with the latest updates.,1
"dotty, this cannot be fixed with python code.",0
"Yes, the patch works.",1
"sorry, but i disagree with that solution. the underlying problem is described in https://issues.kolab.org/issue3801 and https://issues.kolab.org/issue2869, this is a bug in the kolab server, it s not reporting an error when logging in without the domain name and instead just lists no folders",0
i'm glad to say that the issue appears fixed for me too in hardy today.,1
"Sorry, I could not see the relevance, as I understand.",0
"I agree that it is convenient to be able to set a default value from the place it is used (e.g., the Image->Scale dialog) instead of having to open the Preferences and find the corresponding option.",1
Didn't get the result I expected,0
"Bryce, yes that sounds reasonable, although the data is only from one single user.",1
so I don't think it's Ubuntu-specific.,0
I don't have the problem with a recent kernel any more. It works for me.,1
i had tried xfce awhile back under gdm and that did not work.,0
"I have this same problem, I've just tested using Ubuntu 8.10 beta, It happens the same problem using 8.04, but there is no problem with 7.10.",1
"however, it is not obvious to me that these patches will fix the bug you have attached them to (which is almost certainly fixed in gutsy anyway).",0
I'm having this issue as well (Ubuntu 9.04 64-bit).,1
Bug is still present in Nautilus version 1:2.20.0-0ubuntu7 but is now intermittent.,0
"Hi, I can confirm that MSI M662 has the same touchpad and has the exactly same behavior listed above.",1
impossible to do it again because i cannot connect to the net.,0
"@clovepower, I think you are right.",1
"however, it is not portable at all.",0
"Happens here too on a brand new T61 with irq 23, pretty much same backtrace, with latest kernel from gutsy.",1
"looks like your patch never made it into udev, mdz.",0
"i guess you ' re right martin, but this will make the patch a little bit more complicated as the current patching mechanism is not very helpful in counting added/removed lines",1
it seems gnome 2.18 won't include this patches.,0
@Miika-Petteri Matikainen: Patch3 works beautifully for me! Corrects the issues I had originally.,1
Actually I would like not to add yet another entry in intl.css but to fix it in aboutMozilla.xhtml.,0
"i second mike's description of the problem, above.",1
i don't think gnome was configured to use pulseaudio as far as i didn't configure anything.,0
roma's solution worked for me!,1
"The same casper-rw file system corruption happens here in the Lucid 10.04.2. I was first tricked to believe there were bad blocks, then realized I was wrong after more test and Google to this thread. I know Steve's patch is not for the Lucid but I still tried, hoping it will work.",0
seems to work fine now.,1
both ekiga 3.2.5 and ekiga-snapshot give me this error on Karmic. I cannot use my sip programs even if I stop the moblock,0
"I can confirm that this bug is still an issue on Ubuntu 9.10, and that the workaround suggested by Pablo Rodr铆guez works.",1
"In my case, Master doesn't do a thing, but PCM instead changes volume just fine.",0
Can confirm that setting wireless rate to 5.5M works wonders. Getting consistent 450 KB/s transfer rates now and seems stable.,1
to me it's not really an option.,0
"i guess you ' re right martin, but this will make the patch a little bit more complicated as the current patching mechanism is not very helpful in counting added/removed lines",1
I think they just made the scrolling a bit faster but they didn't make a way for us to set the scroll speed. So the upstream bug wasn't really the same as the downstream one.,0
"I unchecked the ""use time"" box in gconf, and it's working fine.",1
Smashing my head against this right now. I see that those Jaunty packages depend on newer versions of libc and stuff. I'm currently running Intrepid but this is a production box and I don't really want to use a development version.,0
I solved my problem,1
but keeping backups of kernels all the time isn't a nice solution either.,0
"I agree that it is convenient to be able to set a default value from the place it is used (e.g., the Image->Scale dialog) instead of having to open the Preferences and find the corresponding option.",1
"i don't believe this is related to the exact package being installed, rather the installer itself or a back-end process.",0
"KamleshUbuntu, thanks for the update. This sounds promising for you.",1
"no, i do not use a virtual private network.",0
Mario Carrion's comment was an insipration. I took a guess and added this to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base options snd-hda-intel model=thinkpad-t61p at the very end of the file.,1
"According to the wiki page above, my card shouldn't be blacklisted.",0
the file is working fine for me...,1
"There's no need to disable MSI for the whole kernel, one can fix this applying appropriate flags to a forcedeth module",0
I get the same buggy video playback.,1
Jon Phillips does not represent any organization through this email address.,0
this seems like a good patch but i haven ' t tested it since i don ' t have a test case,1
"i just tried removing active-updates.xml and that didn ' t seem to help. in fact, i can ' t seem to find the .mar file from the second update cycle anywhere on my hdd.",0
The proposed workaround solved the issue for me !,1
"Jared, Igor and Exactt and others with problems introduced in recent Ubuntu versions: This bug is related to something introduced in Gutsy (version 7.10). I still (!) have problems related to this.",0
"status confirmed i agree, the least we should do is give a proper error.",1
"It may not be related, but we were having speed issues with tracker in some computers here",0
Alex claims this to be fixed in gutsy.,1
kdesu version 1.1-0ubuntu2.2 doesn't fix it.,0
In my system I had the same problem.,1
I have just noticed this bug marked won't fix and wishlist.,0
i can confirm that the package posted by pavel rojtberg fixed this problem for me.,1
"It was fixed a while ago for most camera's (see earlier in this bug report), but the D40x is still broken",0
"after completely uninstalling network-manager, all problems solved, the card works nicelly.",1
phaserman: this is not the same problem as your link.,0
"i am having the same 'gnome-terminal' problem, except my computer is far away in a server room, so i am using nx client to log into it.",1
"crap, sorry, that should have been ubuntu. not baltix",0
"Yes, I did, and it seems to work as a workaround",1
"i don't think i loged in and out, as i'm the only one using this machine, and don't usually log out, but i've seen this abnormal behaviour several times.",0
"Confirming Vitor Lamas Gatti's comment; it works great on 7.04, but crashes on 7.10.",1
"anyway, this is not something to be fixed, but rather a change that needs to be discussed with people like e.g. leinir.",0
i have tried it with a nvidia raid controller and it works!,1
"Thanks for your bugreport. I can not reproduce this behaviour here, If I use 0.59.23 I get the upgrade button.",0
"i have exactly the same problem, but not only in ubuntu, but also with the gparted-livecd 0.3.7-5.",1
tried to boot on different machines and different cd drives with no success.,0
"I had the same problem, i have ubuntu karmic amd64.",1
I'm still seeing the issue with my machine updated to hardy and using linux-image-2.6.24-11-generic. On boot I get dropped to a busybox shell because the hdd/controller cannot be initialized.,0
"Yes. The intention here is to respond to events instead of having absolute values like the previous design. So that unplugging is an event that is responded to, and so is plugging in or going idle.",1
"i don't think ntpd can help me here, as it is designed to correct small time drifts, update daylight savings etc.",0
Actually I am having the same problem too,1
"Sorry, it's been available since 1.2.3, but it hasn't been included in any Ubuntu package.",0
I've been having the same issue since Feisty.,1
I'm still running ubuntu 8.04 but actually don't have reproduced the bug since I bought this new PC.,0
"Yes, the patched kernel is for jaunty, but you don't need to change to jaunty to try it out. Simply download the linux-image .deb file for your architecture (i386 or amd64) and install it with gdebi or with dpkg -i then reboot into the new kernel.",1
the fix for zthe applet to not run on ltsp clients.,0
The problem is the same and the update don't resolve nothing....,1
"Tim, the option should be not defined by default, which means auto-rotate for best fit on image files.",0
"#10 Well, it actually is a bug.",1
Martin - It looks like with the fixes in DKMS and kernel that kernel-packages in Gutsy proposed is no longer relevant. I think it is safe to remove.,0
"Yes, I did, and it seems to work as a workaround",1
but i wouldn't call it the white screen of death.,0
This bug was fixed in the package epiphany-browser - 2.22.3-1ubuntu1,1
some flash videos wont play but its not really a showstopper IMHO. same package no changes needed other than changelog to get it to build and run in feisty.,0
I agree in full that the new problem of not being able to receive files from Symbian devices is a new problem and should be tracked in a different bug.,1
I don't agree with the priority assignment either.,0
"I had the bug just after installing ubuntu. So it was with the normal configuration. I have another Ubuntu 7.10 virtualized using Virtual Box and it is affected by this bug, so you can try if you want.",1
the script-fu-select-to-foo scripts are deprecated and do not any longer register a menu entry,0
i absolutely agree that this should be marked high priority.,1
"We don't need most of the information you post, we'll tell you when we want something more.",0
"Hi, I am relatively new to Ubuntu. I am presently using HP 6940 and I have the same complaints. I tried the 'sudo aa-complain cupsd' command with no luck.",1
I've tried booting the new kernel and it makes no difference unfortunately.,0
Brian this fix seems to of worked I now have a res of 1280x800 :) Many thanks.,1
I just tried Kai's fix on a Dell Inspiron 1501 Radeon Xpress 200M runnning Gutsy. No luck though!,0
"Hi, yes it is a very good piece of software. I would like to see it in Ubuntu. Vincent",1
it is still not fixed.,0
"Hi, on my acer-extensa 5620 i had the same problem with internal mic.",1
"i don't think this is worthy of an sru, but it will get picked up the next gutsy lum release.",0
"Hi Dan, new package needs to be included in current Ubuntu development version first before it can be considered for a stable release. Then then the package go though SRU or backport process. I hope this helps.",1
I don't think that this should be dependent on being able to resize freely at all...,0
It is very useful tool and I use it weekly to manage my photos and videos.,1
Update - Aaron says he does not have an ETA for adding 8400M support.,0
I have a customer reporting this same issue and looking forward to provide any further information needed to advance this through resolution.,1
Still not working for me.,0
i also get this error on booting the live cd on my desktop here are the specs of the computer.,1
"The desktop apps didn't slow down significantly or grey out at all (I was running FF3 RC1, a vmware VM, and Thunderbird). I also recently switched to the 32bit kernel, but I don't think the 32bit 2.6.24-17 kernel was any different from the amd64 one with respect to desktop responsiveness under disk I/O load.",0
Indeed the package in proposed is working. Thanks,1
"FWIW, I'm not nearly as keen on disabling that one, and am fairly-to-surely likely to WONTFIX such a bug.",0
"again, i think it ' s a brilliant idea martin",1
"@mirco: your issue is completely different, since you use different hardware.",0
This was working fine for me on my ThinkPad X61T laptop until the latest Kernel this worked fine.,1
"I firstly failed to connect to a unsecured network, but then after that failed, I tried the WPA2 EAP-TTLS/PAP network, and it connected. NM still doesn't store anything in the gnome-keyring, which seems broken in general.",0
I can confirm that Shawn Fisher's fix works just fine on my machine.,1
"sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start Does not work, I get a blank screen.",0
"This was confirmed as fixed for two people, Chris still experienced it.",1
This issue was once fixed already and I have a feeling that this isn't system-config-printer related anymore.,0
I think the most simple solution to this is just to have a simple key for all PPAs.,1
I was able to find the NLS class but I didn't find the BundleFinder class.,0
I have the same reports as to highlight/wrap combinations as Luca.,1
"Hi, I had terribly fluctuating speeds on the SATA drives in my machine, and it sometimes the entire OS would stall and sometimes not. I'm not 100% sure this Ubuntu bug report applies to my situation.",0

thank you gareth for your help but your solution doesn't work for me,0
"The crash happend only on the first run of thinderbird after installing it on a fresh Tribe 2 install. I installed the package ""thunderbird"". Everything is working for the second run.",1
This has not been observed any more since Tribe 3,0
thanks a million sebastian trueg. i really appreciate k3b and its ease of use.,1
you've a long running connection to a web server where you're downloading lots of data so i don't think it's the same cause.,0
"Thank you Daniel Stoyanov for your report, is the crash reproducible? if so, would you please indicate a test case to reproduce it. Indicate which extensions/plugins do you have enabled. Thanks in advance",1
the software is non functioning and misleading.,0

"comment on attachment 555658 thunderbird patch v1 this looks fine, although there may be some ambiguity between whether we are just indexing messages really slowly or are working some other type of jobs",1
"Please do not keep posting +1 comments, it only creates extra bugmail and does not have any constructive purpose.",0
Yeah. I thought about ext4 too.,1
"I think I still can't really ask for sponsorship in this upload, and the next one, didn't know dput would have commented here.",0
Thanks Helton. I have put it in rc.local for now.,1
"No pauses, no windows greying out, and FF3 was responsive all the way through. It's a pity that the server kernel doesn't configure the sound card etc, otherwise I'd just use it instead of the generic one.",0
I agree that Albert's idea makes sense.,1
"One more comment on this; I can understand the ""conservative"" behaviour, but when an array was degraded, the boot process halted with NO MESSAGE indicating what was wrong.",0
Thanks; in the end I got it to work by building the _rpy2051.so library from source using the steps described by Diwakar Gupta on 31 Oct. 2007.,1
"Hi, I tried the riverfr0zen's tip, but it didn't fix a thing.",0
I have been working with my T61 the whole day using the new BIOS and as far as I can tell the problem seems to be really gone,1

i just did as before sudo apt-get install module-assistant (useless cause you already have it if it's not the first time you do the trick) sudo m-a update sudo m-a prepare sudo m-a a-i alsa and it works as before.,1
I don't know if that did something to screw up what I mention below. The compiz thing has been NOT starting right from the get go.,0
"Now that NM 0.7 has landed in jaunty, it would be great if the patch could be applied to the released package.",1
i cannot get bt to connect beyond pairing in any gusty package.,0

"Hi, This is probably the same cause as bug 136837. Thanks, James",1
Note that this was NOT fixed when Ubuntu Beta ISOs were created - it's still very present in Beta LiveCD...,0
worked fine in Feisty.,1
"Ok, I don't want to hijack the bug comments but if you're interested here's my xorg.conf for xinerama with fglrx which works with no kernel module as described.",0
My experience has been the same as Don Melcer's (above);,1
you bug report is probably not related to this one as it is about a different video card.,0
i agree that the names are quite confusing,1
"I don't think it was actually fixed, if you look at the upstream report.",0
Works for me. Thanks Sebastien!,1
I don't think I had them with 52... It happens if my mouse happens to sweep through all the icons on my dock. The only way to get the titles to disappear is to hover back over the icon.,0
I'd like too! Ready to learn!,1
i disagree that it is a regression that is critical for feisty;,0
I have exactly the same problem as Jack on Lenovo X61 tablet.,1
"On average it took 38 seconds using the beta (trackerd disabled, no deskbar applet). However, with the latest updates it takes about 50 seconds.",0
Installing xserver-xgl solved the problem in my case.,1

ok i got the hardy alpha 5 and the sound is ok with good quality..,1
"Sorry, Charlie, I did not realise my comment was lost. I typed it this morning, after doing the test. Perhaps I did not hit the ""post"" button, or the data was lost somewhere else.",0
"But I agree, that some more details wouldn't do any harm - I will try to do that in the future.",1
"I've looked around for ages searching for a solution, following everything that has been mentioned or linked to in the posting above to no avail.",0
I think I may have this same bug with Intrepid Ibex.,1
this was unfortunately not reproducible (or i did something different in betweeen).,0
I'm seeing a similar problem since the gutsy upgrade that would kind of support the video thesis of naught101.,1
i think forcing the keyboard to act like a windows one is a bad idea.,0
this debdiff looks good. thanks for getting it tested!,1

I don't believe the GUI reads your .bashrc so you could set it in /etc/skel/.bashrc,0
Hi there!! I was facing the same problem of you guys.,1
Simple answer: no.,0
but I'm not convinced that the corruption is caused by libc6 because corruption of other packages have occurred as well.,1
i don't think this is a driver problem either.,0
"Hi Richard, thanks for the notice on that commit.",1
commenting the virtual line in xorg did not work for me.,0
This is fixed in our current local repository and it will be part of the next upload.,1
"Looks like they're still working on the ath5k driver, however, since it's been included in the master kernel git tree it means that it's passed whatever standards drivers typically need to be included in the kernel.",0

"malcolm: no, i cannot confirm this.",0
I can confirm that this is busybox. I get segfaults when calling 'busybox mount -o move ...',1
It does not happen every time to me either!,0
Same happens to me on Ubuntu Karmic alpha 6 (64bit) with Firefox 3.5 and flash 10.0.32.18,1
so I don't think that is the problem.,0
It'd be helpful if you were to do some research into this extension and add information about its license etcetera to the wiki page,1
I thought I waited long enough - I had read that comment about the 180s delay - but I didn't. I just tested it again and booting with a detached disc continues after 3 minutes.,0
I agree with vnieto. Simon's route is fine too.,1
Found another small regression.,0
i have the switch user white screen problem as described by exactt as well,1
So the workaround isn't reliable and this package should have it's importance put back to 'High' or at least 'Medium'.,0
"Thanks, Michael Hofmann, for the testing. Patch approved for feisty-proposed",1
Stathis nothing happens.The problem still exist.,0
I have no objection to closing this out and considering it an extension problem.,1
this is not an update to the existing driver as much as a request for an additional driver.,0
The latest ALSA driver does fix the issue (compiled from their repository).,1
"I also confirm that this is not fixed in Intrepid, at least not in the x64 version.",0
"Yes, installing bochsbios from hardy also made my XP-VM work again! Thanks Daniel, for the hint!",1
"Just for the record, this patch is incorrect and shouldn't be applied.",0

I don't think any of this is the right option.,0
changing /dev/hda (the dvd drive's device entry) to /dev/dvd in /etc/fstab as per robert's comment fixed it also for me.,1

Thanks dRewsus! Your workaround has worked for me too.,1

The problem turned out to be with the USB 2 driver. The work around is to run sudo modprobe -r ehci_hcd The problem is resolved when you upgrade the kernel fixed in the 2.6.24-19-generic kernel of Hardy,1

xsensors still doesnt work in my karmic installation too.,0
absolutly no problem at all.,1
Basically the problem here is that apt and aptitude cannot deal with malformed cached files. Probably the ext3 file system did not restore everything correctly.,0

early reports indicate that this patch likely does not solve the problem.,0
"I'm experiencing the same behavior, except mine never quite worked properly under Feisty either.",1
I've hadn't had any problem like that.,0
This should be done for VAIO SZ71 as well. I downloaded a deb of that module for hardy from http://www.arakhne.org/spip.php?article50 and it works like a charm,1

apport said there was a crash I have not noticed anything wrong.,0
I really would recommend that this bug be split into two though - one bug for Intel AIGLX users and the other for open source ATI AIGLX users (and perhaps a comment linking to the other to help people find the right bug). It is quite possible that one of the drivers will be fixed and the other won't before Gutsy is released.,1
the two default gutsy's gnome-panels still remain invisible after desktop is displayed after login.,0

Thanks for reporting and providing debugging info. Milestoning for beta since this seems like a relatively easy fix.,1

Smashing my head against this right now. I see that those Jaunty packages depend on newer versions of libc and stuff. I'm currently running Intrepid but this is a production box and I don't really want to use a development version.,0
